<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are handled in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these items present a threat just. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for significant health problems.<p>
