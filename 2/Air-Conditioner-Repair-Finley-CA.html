<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings constantly progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing somewhat over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be developing as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
