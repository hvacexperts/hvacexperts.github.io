<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Benedict ND</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
