<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate.
