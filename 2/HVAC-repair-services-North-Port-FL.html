<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to supply threshold alerts.
