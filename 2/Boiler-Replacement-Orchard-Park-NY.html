<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Orchard Park NY</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many individuals are becoming more mindful and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing irritants and contaminants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it should be removed to boost and revitalize the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by eliminating the debris from the air filter.<p>
