<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
