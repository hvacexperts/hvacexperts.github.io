<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
