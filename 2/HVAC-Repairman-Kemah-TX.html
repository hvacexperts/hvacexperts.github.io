<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Kemah TX</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
