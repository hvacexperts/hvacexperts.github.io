<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
