<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
