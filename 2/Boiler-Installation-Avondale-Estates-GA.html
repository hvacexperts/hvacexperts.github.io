<h3>Things to Search for When Hiring an Avondale Estates GA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
