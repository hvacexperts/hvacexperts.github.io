The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These should be taken into consideration before choosing the best style of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties needs less pipes to accomplish the preferred underground cooling and heating result, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
