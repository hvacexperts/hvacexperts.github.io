<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office complex such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, lorries such as cars and trucks, trains, airplanes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
