<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
