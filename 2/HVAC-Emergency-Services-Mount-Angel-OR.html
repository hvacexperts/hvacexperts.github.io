<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively.
