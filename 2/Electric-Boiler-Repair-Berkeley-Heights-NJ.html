What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, although it was six months prior to the current one ended.
