<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
