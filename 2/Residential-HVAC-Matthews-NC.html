<h3>HVAC Supply in Matthews NC</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the concern and repaired really quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered extraordinary, personalized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, interesting and efficient. He plainly and thoroughly described all issues and repairs in a manner that made me confident in his capability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to sustain another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in recent memory. He likewise responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a temporary repair to a problem that could not be fixed on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
<p>Just a specialist can accurately detect why your furnace isn't beginning. If at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems weird or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you need to do it frequently, it's probably time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
