<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
