<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.
