I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house.
