<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
