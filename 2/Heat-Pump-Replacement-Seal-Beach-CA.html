<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
