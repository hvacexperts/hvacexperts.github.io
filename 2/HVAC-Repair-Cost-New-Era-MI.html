<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and a/c system.

<p>Particular immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently hard to figure out if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and location the symptoms occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results may be intensified by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>A number of initiatives imagine to decrease indoor air contamination by restricting VOC emissions from items. There are guidelines in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems including low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, in addition to California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and several others in the U.S.A.. These efforts altered the market where an increasing number of low-emitting items has become available throughout the last decades.<p>
<p>You might update to the highest efficiency gear readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system.
