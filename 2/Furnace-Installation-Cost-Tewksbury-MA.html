<p>House comfort is a crucial subject for the majority of people, and it's never more obvious than if your furnace stops working on a cold winter night.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside your home is associated with a greater prevalence of resident breathing problems.<p>
