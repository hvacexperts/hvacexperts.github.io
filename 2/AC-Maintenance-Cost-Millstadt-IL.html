<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
