<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Minooka IL</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. First, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and extremely knowledgeable. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. Due to the fact that the cost was obviously affordable, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
