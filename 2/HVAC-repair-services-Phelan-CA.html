<h3>AC Maintenance in Phelan CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Phelan CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
