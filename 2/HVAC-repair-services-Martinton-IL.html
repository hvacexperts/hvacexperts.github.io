<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
