These various heat sources likewise determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the right temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Only be concerned if your house is not warming up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to call in a professional to inspect and repair the system.<p>
