Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
