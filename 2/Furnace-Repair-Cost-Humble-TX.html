<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products present a threat just when they are dealt with in a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if proper controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for significant illness.<p>
