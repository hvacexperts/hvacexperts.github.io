<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Switched to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to your house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have actually managed the one repair I required well, and are professional and constantly on-time. Have actually been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is absolutely the best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been excellent.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at New Salisbury IN</h3>
<p>I was very happy in the start since things ran smoothly without any noise. Moreover, I saw visible changes in my electricity bills. After 2 years, things started to alter. There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it fixed and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has been a great experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then understood A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
