<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
