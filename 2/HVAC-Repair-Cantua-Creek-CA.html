<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it establishes cracks which leak, they need to be repaired.
