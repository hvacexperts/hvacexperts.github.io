<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Mendon OH</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
