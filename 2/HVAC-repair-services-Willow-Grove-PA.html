<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>When a company compartmentalizes like this, it can even more increase efficiency, cut unnecessary expenses, and increase profits.
