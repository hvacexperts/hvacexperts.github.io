<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

The choice to repair or replace depends on you, and frequently it refers comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the devices, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides greater energy efficiency and features service warranty protection.<p>
