<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually greater than many heatpump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the design you acquire. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This suggests it can heat up your home to the wanted temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild effects that are often mistaken for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, tiredness and disorientation. The effects of CO exposure can vary significantly from person to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
