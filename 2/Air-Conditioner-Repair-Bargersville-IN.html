<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation in Bargersville IN</h3>

(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
