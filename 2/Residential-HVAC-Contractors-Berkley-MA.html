However, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
