<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Companies in Garfield</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
