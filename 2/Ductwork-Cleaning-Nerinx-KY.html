Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air presented into an area per an unit of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
