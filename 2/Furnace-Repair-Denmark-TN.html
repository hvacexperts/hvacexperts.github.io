<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
