<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your employer should examine measurements of air, humidity and temperature circulation. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to specs for developing usage and occupancy) need to be performed. A building walk-through to check for odors and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be practical. Leakages require to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with germs or fungi and need to be removed, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks consist of two cartridge fuses. Inspect them before you proceed with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing system.

Call a pro-- you've got more major problems if it blows once again.<p>
