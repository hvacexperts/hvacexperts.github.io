A building walk-through to check for odors and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be practical. Leakages require to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with germs or fungi and need to be removed, likewise.
