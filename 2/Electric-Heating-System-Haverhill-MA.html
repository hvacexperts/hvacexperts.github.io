<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
