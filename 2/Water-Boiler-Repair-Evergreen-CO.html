<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
