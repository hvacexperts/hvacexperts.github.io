<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of environmentally friendly houses as part of the growing green structure motion. Green tasks represented 20 percent of all freshly constructed houses in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article forecasted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>
