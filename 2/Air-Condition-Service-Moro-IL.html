Reedy chooses the owners stay on and reinvest a portion of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
