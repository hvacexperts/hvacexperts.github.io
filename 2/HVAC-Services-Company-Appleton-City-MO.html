<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe.

Kids, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead.
