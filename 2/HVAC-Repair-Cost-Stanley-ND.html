<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Stanley ND</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
