<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out.

<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Craigville IN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
