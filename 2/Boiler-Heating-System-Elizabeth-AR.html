<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges employed flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heater the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really critical to maintaining a correct temperature level.<p>
