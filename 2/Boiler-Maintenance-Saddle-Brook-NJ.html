<p>Certain immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to determine if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms happen. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very crucial to maintaining a proper temperature.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
