<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same.

Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
