<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
