<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working.

<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
