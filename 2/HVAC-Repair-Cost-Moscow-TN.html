<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>

In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter as soon as every three months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
