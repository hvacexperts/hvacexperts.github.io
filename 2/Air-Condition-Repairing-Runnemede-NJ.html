DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
