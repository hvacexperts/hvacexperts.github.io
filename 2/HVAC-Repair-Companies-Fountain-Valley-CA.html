<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, children, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and many other products.<p>
