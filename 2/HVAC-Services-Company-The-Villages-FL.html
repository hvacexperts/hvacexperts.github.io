<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial freedom.

HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
