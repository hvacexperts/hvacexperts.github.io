<p>Streamline your services, make more services profits, and provide an incredible client experience. To ensure the system you choose is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation quote to figure out the specific kind of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size system you presently have. These computations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>
