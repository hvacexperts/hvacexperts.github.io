<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Burbank CA</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
