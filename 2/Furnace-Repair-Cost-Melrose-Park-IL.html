Not just will blocked vents and registers affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a good concept. You will not save any additional money and will end up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Our company is developed on a foundation of consumer complete satisfaction, fair quotes, and household values. The owner of Mr. Furnace, Tony Contrera, ensures every job is done right, on-time, and estimated properly.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
