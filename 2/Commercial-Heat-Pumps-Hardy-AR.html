<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, but they can be beneficial in more remote areas where energies are harder to gain access to, and in colder environments because it supplies more heat per BTU than other options.

They require a tank on the instant property and more maintenance. In general, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they supply an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
