<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
