<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air.

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
