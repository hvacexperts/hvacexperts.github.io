<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heating unit in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly choice, however more recent systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient natural gas heating systems can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
