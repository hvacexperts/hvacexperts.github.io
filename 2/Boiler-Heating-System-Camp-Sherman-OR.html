<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources might not pose a significant health risk on their own, a lot of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to reduce the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new issues from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good idea to consider energy efficiency. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency ranking as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Efficiency scores need to be labeled with all systems. While efficient systems may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated device is a terrific way to enjoy additional assurance.<p>

Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
