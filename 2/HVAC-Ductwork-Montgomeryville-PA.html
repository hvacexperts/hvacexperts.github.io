<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in place. Moreover, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
