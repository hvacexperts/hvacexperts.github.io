Incorrect change, typically shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame idea is blue. If you buy a new gas stove or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
