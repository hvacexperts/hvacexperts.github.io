<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
