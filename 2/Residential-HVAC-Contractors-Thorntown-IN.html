<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside.

Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
