<h3>AC Compressor in Lamy NM</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working.

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Lamy NM?</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
