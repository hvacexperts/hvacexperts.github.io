<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair in Faber VA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems must be examined a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
