<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
