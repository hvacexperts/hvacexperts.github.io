<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Just an expert can precisely detect why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose confidence, it's time to call an expert.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it often, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
