<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
