<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Berryville AR</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
