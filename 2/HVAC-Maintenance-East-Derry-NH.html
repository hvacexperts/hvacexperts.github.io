<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
