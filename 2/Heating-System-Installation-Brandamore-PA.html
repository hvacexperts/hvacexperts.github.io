<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
