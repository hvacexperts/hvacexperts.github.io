<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
