<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Jayess MS</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using clever innovation. Martin stated the company can develop a dashboard within the structure's controls that will supply data on its systems to enable actual time presence, supplying the ability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial client, not simply during new construction.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
