<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Fair Bluff NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out.
