Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits.

Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
