As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't believe adequate about exposure to all the important things we place in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<p>Because they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
