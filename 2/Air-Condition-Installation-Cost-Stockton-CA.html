<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, unpredictable organic compounds ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce negative health conditions. Source control, purification and making use of ventilation to water down pollutants are the primary approaches for improving indoor air quality in most structures. Residential systems can further enhance indoor air quality by regular cleaning of carpets and rug.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may show up soon after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and generally short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma might show up, be intensified or aggravated.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the quantity (and often quality) of outside air that need to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
