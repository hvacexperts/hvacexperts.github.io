<h3>Heating And Cooling Systems in Tranquillity CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Never Ignore in Tranquillity CA</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
