<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
