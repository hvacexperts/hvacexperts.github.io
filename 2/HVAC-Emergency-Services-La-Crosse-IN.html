<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
