<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use.

Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
