<p>All heater have some level of air filtering. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
