<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board need to be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>

The impacts of CO exposure can differ significantly from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
