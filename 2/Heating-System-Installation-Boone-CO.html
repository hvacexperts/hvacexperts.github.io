<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
