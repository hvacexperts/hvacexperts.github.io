<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
