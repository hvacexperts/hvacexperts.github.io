<p>Brian was every bit honest, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, valuable and useful - his work was flawless! All of his assistants were courteous and diligent. The work site was left utterly cleared and cleaned up.

<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heater, you may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
