However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
