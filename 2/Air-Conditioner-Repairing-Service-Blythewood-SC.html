<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Blythewood SC?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
