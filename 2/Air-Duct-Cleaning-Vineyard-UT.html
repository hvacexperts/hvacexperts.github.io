<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
