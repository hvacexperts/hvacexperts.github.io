<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The EPA advises that you have your duct examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor. If your technician finds that your air ducts have significant mold, dust, dirt, and other impurities or a moldy odor, they may suggest duct cleaning This is especially important if somebody in your household has asthma, allergic reactions, or other signs that may be connected to indoor air pollution.<p>

<p>Heaters are like cars. As they age, you can replace one part only require another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>Throughout regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can build up on internal parts.
