<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not position a significant health threat on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to lower the threat from existing sources and to avoid new problems from occurring. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
