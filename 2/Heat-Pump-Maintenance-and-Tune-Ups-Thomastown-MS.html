<p>There are lots of things to take into consideration when attempting to figure out how often I must change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how often your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter require replacing more frequently.<p>
