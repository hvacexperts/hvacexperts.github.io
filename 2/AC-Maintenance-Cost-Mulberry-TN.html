<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can mean significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
