<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Pewaukee WI</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE scores frequently come with greater cost. So, ensure to decide based upon how often you will use your heating unit, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.
