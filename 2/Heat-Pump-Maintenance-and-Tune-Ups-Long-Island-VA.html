<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon private sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>

Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home.
