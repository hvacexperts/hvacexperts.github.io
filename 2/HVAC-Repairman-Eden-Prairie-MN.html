<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Eden Prairie MN?</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air conditioning, you have a couple of choices when it pertains to central heating systems. We'll delve into expenses later, however you can pick from a boiler, heat or furnace  pump. In general, heaters are the most cost effective alternative. Nevertheless, your option will mainly boil down to what your ducts allow or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable choice.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
