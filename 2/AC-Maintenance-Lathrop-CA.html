<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
