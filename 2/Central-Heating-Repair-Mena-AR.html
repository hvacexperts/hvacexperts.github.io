<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Mena AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Mena AR</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
