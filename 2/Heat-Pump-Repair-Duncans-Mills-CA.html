<p>If your ac system is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a basic issue like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Duncans Mills CA</h3>
<p>While pollutant levels from private sources may not present a substantial health risk by themselves, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that many people can take both to minimize the threat from existing sources and to avoid new problems from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain short cycling in very cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will simply run harder to preserve a warm environment for your house when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact among our technicians if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items provide a risk just when they are handled in such a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if correct controls are not in location. This can lead to the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
