<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been appropriately dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
