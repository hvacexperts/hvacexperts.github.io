Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Williamson GA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are usually not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve an effectiveness greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also because a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
