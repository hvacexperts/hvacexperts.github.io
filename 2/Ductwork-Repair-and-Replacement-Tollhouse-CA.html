<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>Immediate results might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and usually short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To discover smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
