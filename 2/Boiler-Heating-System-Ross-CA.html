<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear really daunting initially, needing specialized tools, devices, and know-how.

<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every 4 years. The Principles Handbook consists of heating and cooling computations.

Other useful reference materials include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
