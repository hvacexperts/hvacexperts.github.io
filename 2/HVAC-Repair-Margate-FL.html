<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
