<p>If you have a big house, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air might not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

<p>Old heaters typically begin to make some odd noises as they get toward completion of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or screeching noises coming from your furnace?

Does your blower turn on and off frequently or does it blow cold air in some cases? If so, this is a sign that your furnace might need to be replaced.<p>
