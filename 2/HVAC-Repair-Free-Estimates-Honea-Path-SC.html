<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms.

Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
