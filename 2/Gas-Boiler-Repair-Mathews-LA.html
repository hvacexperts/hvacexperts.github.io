<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
