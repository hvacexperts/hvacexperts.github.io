<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
