<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Truth About Hiring Conshohocken PA HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
