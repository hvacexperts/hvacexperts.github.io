<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
