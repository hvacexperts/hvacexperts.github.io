<p>Many AC systems come with a variety of special functions that can further improve efficiency and performance.

Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy expenses a lot more.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
