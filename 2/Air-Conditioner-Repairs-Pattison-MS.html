<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way.
