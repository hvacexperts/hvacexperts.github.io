<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
