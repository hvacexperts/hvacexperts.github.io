<p>Sean was really handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a business or retailer to do the installation. If you choose to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system.
