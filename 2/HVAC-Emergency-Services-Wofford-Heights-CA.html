We focus on fair and truthful treatment, integrating tested equipment with affordable pricing and proficient and diligent craftsmanship.

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
