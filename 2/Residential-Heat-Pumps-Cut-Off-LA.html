He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
