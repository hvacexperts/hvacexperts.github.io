Since they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon going into the home, the effectiveness of these devices is uncertain.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
