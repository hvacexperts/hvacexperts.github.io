<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the result of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation. Work environment temperatures ought to be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air blood circulation must be avoided.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
