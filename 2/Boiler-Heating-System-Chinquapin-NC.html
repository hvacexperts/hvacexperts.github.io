The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions since they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
