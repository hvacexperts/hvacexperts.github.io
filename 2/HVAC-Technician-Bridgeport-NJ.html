<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Bridgeport</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be contaminated (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these pollutants throughout the house.
