Many typical structure materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently suggested instead.<p>
