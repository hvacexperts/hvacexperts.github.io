Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
