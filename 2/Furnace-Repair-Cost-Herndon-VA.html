<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the spaces, consisting of the human residents.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used typically in a variety of building construction products for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos items. Makers have also willingly restricted uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most frequently discovered in older homes, in pipeline and furnace insulation materials, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating products, and flooring tiles.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and typically are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
