<p>The predominant health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
