<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
