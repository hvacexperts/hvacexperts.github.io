<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short cycling in very winter. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperatures.
