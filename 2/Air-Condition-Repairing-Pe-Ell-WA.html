<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, given that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
