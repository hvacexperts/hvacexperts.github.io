<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

By contrast, changing a furnace and checking filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
