<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family home installation service totally turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
