<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards normally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
