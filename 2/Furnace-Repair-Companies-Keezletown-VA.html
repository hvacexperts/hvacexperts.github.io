<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
