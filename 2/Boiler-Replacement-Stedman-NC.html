Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear.

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>
