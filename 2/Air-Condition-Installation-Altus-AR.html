<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future).

The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
