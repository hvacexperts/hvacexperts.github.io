<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
