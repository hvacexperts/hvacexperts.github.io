<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness indoors is related to a greater frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the general indoor air quality satisfies a specific standard. Occupational direct exposure limitations noted in health and wellness regulations and the Limit Limit Worths ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to prevent disease or certain impacts (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial situations. These limits might not be proper in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
