<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Leon VA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.

<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Leon VA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
