<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
