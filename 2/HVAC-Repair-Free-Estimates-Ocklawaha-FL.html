<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in top condition for the air conditioner to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home.

Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
