<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to likewise be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners need to look out to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development.

Lots of attics are likewise being transformed to complete bed rooms to include additional area. Rooms in the upper locations of homes are particularly prone to getting incredibly hot and uncomfortable throughout the summer season, making air conditioning a lot more needed.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
