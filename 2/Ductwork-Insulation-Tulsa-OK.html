The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any air flow limitation will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
