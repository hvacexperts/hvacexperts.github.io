<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins released by people, and associates with human metabolic activity.

Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings.

<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
