Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Shannon AL Home</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
