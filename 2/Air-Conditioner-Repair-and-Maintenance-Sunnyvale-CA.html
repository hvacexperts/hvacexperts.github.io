<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Services in Sunnyvale</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. There are numerous style methods in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.
