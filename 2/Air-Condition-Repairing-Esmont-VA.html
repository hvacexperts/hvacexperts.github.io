In other cases, such modifications subtly and even dramatically alter structures in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their influence on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, a few of the techniques used by researchers studying communities, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also create particulates and should be vented outside.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
