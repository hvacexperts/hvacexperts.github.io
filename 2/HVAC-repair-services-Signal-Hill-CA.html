<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
