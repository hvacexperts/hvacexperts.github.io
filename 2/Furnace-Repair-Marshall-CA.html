<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in Marshall CA</h3>
<p>Absolutely nothing can destroy a warm summer season afternoon like a malfunctioning air conditioner. When you need prompt, professional cooling compressor repair services, the team at Around the Clock Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. is at your service.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>In addition, homeowners have a variety of alternatives to select from in powering a floor heater. Radiant systems are compatible with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources. As numerous property owners are all too aware, legacy furnace systems are typically restricted to working on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can vary, rates spike and you can wind up paying more to heat your home no matter how low you set your thermostat.<p>
