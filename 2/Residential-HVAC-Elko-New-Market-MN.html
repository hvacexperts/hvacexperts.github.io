<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
