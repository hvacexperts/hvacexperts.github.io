<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy intake and temperatures in stores to save money on costs (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores fluctuate outside of an appropriate variety that might prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
