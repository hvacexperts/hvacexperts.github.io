<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.
