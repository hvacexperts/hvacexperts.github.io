<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
