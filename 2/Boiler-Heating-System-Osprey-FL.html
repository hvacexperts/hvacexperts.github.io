<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
