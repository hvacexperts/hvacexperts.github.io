<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body.

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the house.

<p>The main factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used.

Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
