<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Everyone we spoke with from starting to end were very professional, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening.
