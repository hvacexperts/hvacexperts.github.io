<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Douglasville GA</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family home installation business totally turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
