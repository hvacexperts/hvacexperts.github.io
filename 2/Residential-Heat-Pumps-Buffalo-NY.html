<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>There are some more severe threats for HVAC employees that might be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be toxic. As HVAC technicians frequently come into contact with electrical wiring, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are risks associated with the job, it is normally carried out securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
<p>Prior to installing any new heating or cooling system in a home, it is required to re reduce the energy and examine load of the home. A more energy efficient home will not only lower the cost of a brand-new system and energy expenses, but it will significantly enhance the convenience of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Standard enhancements normally include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest numerous qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
