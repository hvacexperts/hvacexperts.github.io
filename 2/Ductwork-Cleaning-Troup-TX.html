<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
