During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
