<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Alpine UT</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Gas furnace repair professionals know that many mechanical failure in heaters is because of defective initial installation or a repair that wasnâ $ t made correctly. Thatâ $ s why we suggest getting estimates for furnace repair and new furnace installation from a number of HVAC companies.
