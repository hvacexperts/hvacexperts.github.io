<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
