Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust.

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
