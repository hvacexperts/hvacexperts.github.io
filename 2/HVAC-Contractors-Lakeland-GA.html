<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin arising from gas that leaves into your house without being burned off.

In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
