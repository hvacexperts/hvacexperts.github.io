<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
