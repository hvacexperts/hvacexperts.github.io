<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the examination on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new homeowner I have discovered how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
