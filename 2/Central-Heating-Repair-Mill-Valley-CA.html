<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
