PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room a/c offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
