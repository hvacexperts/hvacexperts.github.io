<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Haralson GA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and extremely well-informed. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. Due to the fact that the cost was clearly reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
