Every one of our heating and air service technicians, plumbing technicians and electrical experts work hard to supply the very best customer service experience possible and as winners of Lincoln's 2014 Bbb Integrity Award, we know these efforts have not gone undetected.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the concern and fixed extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My eldest boy constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
