<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
