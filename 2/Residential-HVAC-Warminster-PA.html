Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Review your records from tracking your service calls, installation sales, service arrangements and other sales, together with the profits and revenue for each category.
