<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Review your records from tracking your service calls, installation sales, service arrangements and other sales, together with the profits and revenue for each category.
