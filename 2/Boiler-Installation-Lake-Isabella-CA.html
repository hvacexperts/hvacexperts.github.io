<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
