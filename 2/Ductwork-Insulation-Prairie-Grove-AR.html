A/c unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is very important in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>

Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
