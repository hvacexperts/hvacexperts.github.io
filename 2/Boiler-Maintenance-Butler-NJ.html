<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of wetness or other outside pollutant, it might work as a pathway to bring the pollutants inside.

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips.
