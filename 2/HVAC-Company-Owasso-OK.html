<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
