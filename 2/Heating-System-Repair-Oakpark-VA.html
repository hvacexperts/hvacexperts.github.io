<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We know that you desire a system you can depend on to keep your family comfy throughout the year. No matter what kind of cooling or heating unit you have, we can assist you to save money, enhance energy effectiveness, and improve indoor air quality by updating and effectively preserving these systems. At Bob's Heating & Air Conditioning, our group of dedicated heating and air specialists in Seattle are specially-trained and PTCS-Certified. You can be certain that all of our work is high-grade and will surpass or satisfy building code requirements.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
