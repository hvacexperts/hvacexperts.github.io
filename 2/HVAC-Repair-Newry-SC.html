<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
