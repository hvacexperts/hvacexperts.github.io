<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
