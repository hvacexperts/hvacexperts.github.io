<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
