<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not present a considerable health danger on their own, most houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious risk from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that most people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing contaminants.

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
