<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
