<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building products, smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
