<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat.

If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
