<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
