Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
