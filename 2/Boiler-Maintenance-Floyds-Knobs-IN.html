Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, however care must be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or humid climates, keeping thermal comfort exclusively through natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
