Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may likewise be a problem.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electrical energy. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
