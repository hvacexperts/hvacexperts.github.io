Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
