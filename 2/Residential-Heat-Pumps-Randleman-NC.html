<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Randleman NC</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
