<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
