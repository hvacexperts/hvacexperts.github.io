<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
