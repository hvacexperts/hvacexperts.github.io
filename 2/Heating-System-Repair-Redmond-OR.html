<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
