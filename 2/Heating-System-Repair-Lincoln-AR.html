<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Lincoln AR?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

If you select to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided warranty won't do you any good need to the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and employ a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
