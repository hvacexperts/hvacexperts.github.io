<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
