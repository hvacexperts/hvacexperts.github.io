<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

In other words, the HVAC technician has three objectives: Avoid issues. Save money. Stay comfy.

<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
