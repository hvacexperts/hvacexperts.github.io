<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
