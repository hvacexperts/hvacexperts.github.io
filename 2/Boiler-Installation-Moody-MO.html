<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12.
