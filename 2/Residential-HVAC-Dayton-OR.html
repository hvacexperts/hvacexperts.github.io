<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is typically acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
