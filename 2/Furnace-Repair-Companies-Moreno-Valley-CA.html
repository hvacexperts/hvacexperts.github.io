<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
