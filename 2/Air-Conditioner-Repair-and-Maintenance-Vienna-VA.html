<p>All Points Heating uses house air conditioning, air conditioning unit installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that provide reputable, proven efficiency at high performance.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance benefit. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
