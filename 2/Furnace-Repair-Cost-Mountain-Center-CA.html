<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
