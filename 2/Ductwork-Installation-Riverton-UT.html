<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
