Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
