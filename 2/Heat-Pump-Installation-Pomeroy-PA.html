Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
