<p>Today's house convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a restroom floor or be set up throughout the whole sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
