<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
