<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
