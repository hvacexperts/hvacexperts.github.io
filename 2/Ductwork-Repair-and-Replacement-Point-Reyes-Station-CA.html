<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years back and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
