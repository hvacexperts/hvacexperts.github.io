<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
