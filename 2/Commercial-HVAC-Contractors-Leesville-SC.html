<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Whatever heating system you set up, it's vital that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced.

<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about potential effects of indoor air pollution.
