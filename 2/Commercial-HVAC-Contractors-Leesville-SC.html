<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
