For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside your home is connected with a greater frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air.

Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
