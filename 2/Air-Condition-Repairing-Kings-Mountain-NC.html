<p>A geothermal desuperheater is beneficial and extremely efficient, specifically during the Summer while the system acts to cool one's home. This is because the excess heat taken in from within your house is conducted into the warm water tank rather than being sent back into the earth. The result, for that reason, is free hot water!
