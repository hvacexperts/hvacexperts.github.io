<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
