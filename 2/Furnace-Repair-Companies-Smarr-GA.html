In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold remediation might be required. Mold testing and examinations need to be carried out by an independent detective to prevent any dispute of interest and to guarantee accurate results; complimentary mold screening provided by remediation companies is not recommended.<p>
