<p>Oftentimes, if materials have stopped working to dry out a number of days after the suspected water event, mold growth is thought within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible. Through a mold investigation, which might include harmful inspection, one must be able to figure out the presence or absence of mold. In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold remediation might be required. Mold testing and examinations need to be carried out by an independent detective to prevent any dispute of interest and to guarantee accurate results; complimentary mold screening provided by remediation companies is not recommended.<p>
