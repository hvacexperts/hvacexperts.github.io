<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
