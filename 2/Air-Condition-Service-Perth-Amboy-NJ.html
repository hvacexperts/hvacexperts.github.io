<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
