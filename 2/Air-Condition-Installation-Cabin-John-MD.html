<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, as opposed to industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
