<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
