Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, however they can be beneficial in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to gain access to, and in cooler environments due to the fact that it offers more heat per BTU than other options.

In general, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they supply an AFUE rating of in between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
