<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
