<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling.

Similar to measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of system for your home likewise depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.
