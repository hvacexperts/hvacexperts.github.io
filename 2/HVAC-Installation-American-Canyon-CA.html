<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
