HVAC professionals suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
