<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older homes might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
