<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
