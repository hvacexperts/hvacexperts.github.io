<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
