Secondly, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit needs to likewise be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively released outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly.
