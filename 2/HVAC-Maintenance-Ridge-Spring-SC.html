<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Ridge Spring SC</h3>
<p>There are two primary forms of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are hardly ever used due to long-lasting destructive concerns. Virtually all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, will not rust and can be found in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
