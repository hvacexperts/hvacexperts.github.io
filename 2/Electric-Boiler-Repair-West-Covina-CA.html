<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
