<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Stanton MI</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, terrible summertime.<p>
