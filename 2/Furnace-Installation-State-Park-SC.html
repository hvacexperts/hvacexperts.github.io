In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same.
