<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
