<p>Think about potential effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater effectively changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
