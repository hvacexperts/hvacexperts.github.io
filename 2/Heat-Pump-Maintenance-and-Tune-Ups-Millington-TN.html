<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Millington TN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
