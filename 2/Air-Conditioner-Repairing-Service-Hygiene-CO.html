<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
