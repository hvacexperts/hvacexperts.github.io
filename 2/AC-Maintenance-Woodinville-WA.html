<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>My oldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did in the past.
