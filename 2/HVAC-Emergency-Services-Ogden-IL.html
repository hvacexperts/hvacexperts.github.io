<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
