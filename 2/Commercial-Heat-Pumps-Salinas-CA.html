<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below.

Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

People likewise respond very differently to direct exposure to indoor air pollutants.
