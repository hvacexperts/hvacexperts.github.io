Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day.
