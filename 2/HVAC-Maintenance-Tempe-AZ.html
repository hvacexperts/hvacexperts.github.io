<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

<p>Iâ $ m actually choosy with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

Am grateful I got this though because it has restored my faith in great manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got given that I purchased it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
