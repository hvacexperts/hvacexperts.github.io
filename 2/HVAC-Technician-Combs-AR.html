<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
