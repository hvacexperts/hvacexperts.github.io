<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Minneapolis MN</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
