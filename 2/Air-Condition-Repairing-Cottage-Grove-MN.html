<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit?

Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c won't have the ability to cool the house appropriately. When shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account.
