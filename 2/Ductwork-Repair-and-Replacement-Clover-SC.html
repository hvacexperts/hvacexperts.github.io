<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne.
