<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Dixon MO</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home. The size of the system figures out the labor hours included to develop the system. To equip a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand brand-new furnace or more when you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour.<p>

This can result in the potential for significant health issue.<p>
