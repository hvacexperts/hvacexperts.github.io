<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. There are several style methods in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration.

The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
