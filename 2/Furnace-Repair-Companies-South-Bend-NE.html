<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating unit, you may try to find a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
