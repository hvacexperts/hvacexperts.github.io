<h3>Ductless AC System in Benson NC</h3>
<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.
