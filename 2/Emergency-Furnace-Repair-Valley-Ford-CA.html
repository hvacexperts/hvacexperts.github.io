<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
