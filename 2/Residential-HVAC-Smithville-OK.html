<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
