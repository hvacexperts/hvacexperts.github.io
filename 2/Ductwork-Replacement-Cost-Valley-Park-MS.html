<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
