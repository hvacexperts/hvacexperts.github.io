<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same way as an automobile radiator or common household a/c unit does.

<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
