<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your cooling devices. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
