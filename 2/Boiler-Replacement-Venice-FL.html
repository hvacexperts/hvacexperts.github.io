<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of a/c, a number of primary aspects need to be thought about.

Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
