Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
