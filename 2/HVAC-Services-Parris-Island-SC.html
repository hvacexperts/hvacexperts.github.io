Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Truth About Parris Island SC Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I should say it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off your home which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
