<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness inside your home is related to a greater occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>
