<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically greater than lots of heatpump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you acquire.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
