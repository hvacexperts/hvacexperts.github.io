<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance benefit. Ductless heatpump are great for additions since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
