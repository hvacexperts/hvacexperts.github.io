<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
