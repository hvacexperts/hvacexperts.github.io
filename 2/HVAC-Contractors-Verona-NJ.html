<p>There are lots of reasons this can occur. Fortunately is that you can deal with much of these elements by yourself without the requirement to call for expert help.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
