<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
