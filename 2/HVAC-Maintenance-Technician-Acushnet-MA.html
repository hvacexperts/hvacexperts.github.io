<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Acushnet MA</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to preserving an appropriate temperature.<p>
