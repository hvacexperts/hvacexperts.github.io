<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Browns Summit NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
