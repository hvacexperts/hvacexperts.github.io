<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne toxins from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
