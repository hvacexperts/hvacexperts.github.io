<p>For entire home setups, it's difficult, if nearly impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system.

<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
