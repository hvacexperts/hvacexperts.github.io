<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
