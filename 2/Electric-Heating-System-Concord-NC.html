<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Concord NC</h3>
<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or skills essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>

Ask us about our maintenance program that can conserve you 25 percent on service over the life of your system.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
