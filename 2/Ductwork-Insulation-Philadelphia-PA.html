<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must hire a professional to inspect and repair the unit.<p>

Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
