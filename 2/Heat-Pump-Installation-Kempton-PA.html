<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
