<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Lawrence MA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
