<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such elements consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas emitted by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
