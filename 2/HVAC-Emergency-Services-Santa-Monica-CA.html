<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation.
