<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
