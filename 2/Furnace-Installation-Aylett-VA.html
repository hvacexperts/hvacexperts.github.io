<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
