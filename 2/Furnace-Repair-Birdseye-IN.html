<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
