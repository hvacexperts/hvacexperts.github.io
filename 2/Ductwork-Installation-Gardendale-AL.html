<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Gardendale AL</h3>
<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures must not be undertaken until these issues have been corrected.<p>
