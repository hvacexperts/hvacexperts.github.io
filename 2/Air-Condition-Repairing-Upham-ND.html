<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
