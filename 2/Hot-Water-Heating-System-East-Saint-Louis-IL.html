<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I have become fairly adept at researching products on line prior to acquiring them. Nevertheless I do not find that there is a central place for searching info about the "true" value of house HVAC systems or possibly I ought to state a sincere assessment of these products.
