<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Buffalo IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the issue and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
