<p>Are you including a new space onto your home? Maybe you have a room with unique heating and cooling obstacles, such as spaces that constantly seem to be too hot or too cold. That's where ductless ACs come in! Also called mini splits" or split level Air conditioners," ductless A/cs can be set up in your house without all the pesky ductwork that comes with traditional HVAC systems.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we provide recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

Nevertheless, thinking about recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be better to change the entire system.<p>
