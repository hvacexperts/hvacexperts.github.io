<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Mount Sidney VA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
