<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still warms to the right temperature.

If your house is not heating up, just be worried. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must hire an expert to repair the unit and inspect.<p>
