<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Walnut Grove MO</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
