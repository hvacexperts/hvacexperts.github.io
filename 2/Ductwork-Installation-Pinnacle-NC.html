<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
