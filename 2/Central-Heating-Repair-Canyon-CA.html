<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can generally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
