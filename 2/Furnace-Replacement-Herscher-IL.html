Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a restroom floor or be set up throughout the whole sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
