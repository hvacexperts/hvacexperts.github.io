<p>A customized a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
