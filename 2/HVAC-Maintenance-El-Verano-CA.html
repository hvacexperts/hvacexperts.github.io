Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
