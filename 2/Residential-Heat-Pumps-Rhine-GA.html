<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
