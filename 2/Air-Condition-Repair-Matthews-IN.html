<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
