<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC companies will price out things like specialized filter modifications during Preventative Maintenance check outs, separately, as an add on service for you. No two systems are exactly the same, but filter modifications are something we offer throughout PM gos to if the client requires it- especially the unattainable filters- because we understand how essential it is that they be changed out & how tough it can be for a home owner to do it.<p>
<p>Even after performing these jobs to increase the performance and longevity of your Seattle HVAC system, you must employ a professional to deal with problems quickly when they emerge and carry out thorough maintenance once a year or as required.
