<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
