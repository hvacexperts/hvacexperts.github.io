<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
