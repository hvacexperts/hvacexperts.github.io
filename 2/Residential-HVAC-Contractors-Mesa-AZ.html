<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
