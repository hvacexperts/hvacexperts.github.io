<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out.

So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then change it ON.

You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
