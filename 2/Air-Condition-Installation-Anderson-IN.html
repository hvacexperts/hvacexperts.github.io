<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
