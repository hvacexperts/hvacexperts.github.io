And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
