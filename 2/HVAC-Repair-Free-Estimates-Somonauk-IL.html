Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the exterior of the system and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They might recommend that you trim thick trees or bushes to guarantee adequate air flow around the system.<p>

Other helpful recommendation products include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work properly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
