<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
