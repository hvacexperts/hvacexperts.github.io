<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
