<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
