<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
