<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, think about possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system appropriately adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
