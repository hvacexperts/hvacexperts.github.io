<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the spaces. Many modern-day warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
