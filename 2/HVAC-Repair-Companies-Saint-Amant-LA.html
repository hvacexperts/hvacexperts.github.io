<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
