<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
