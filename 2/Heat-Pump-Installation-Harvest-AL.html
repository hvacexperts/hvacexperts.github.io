<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
