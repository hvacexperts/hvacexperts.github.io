<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may end up being extremely dirty. These elements of the equipment are essential for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all elements, and examines connections to guarantee they are safe. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for appropriate function and general condition. This is an exceptional chance to identify parts that are worn or defective. Changing them to fix the air conditioning might be a lot less costly when the issue is fairly small.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to search for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
