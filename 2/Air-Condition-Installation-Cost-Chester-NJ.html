<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
