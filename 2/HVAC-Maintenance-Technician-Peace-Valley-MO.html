<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
