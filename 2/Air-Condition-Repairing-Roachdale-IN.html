<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competition for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical salaries for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 annually.<p>
