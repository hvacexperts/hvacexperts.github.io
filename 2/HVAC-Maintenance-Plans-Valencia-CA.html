<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with choices, without pushing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
