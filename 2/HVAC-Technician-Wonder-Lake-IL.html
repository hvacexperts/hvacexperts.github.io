<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path.

However, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
