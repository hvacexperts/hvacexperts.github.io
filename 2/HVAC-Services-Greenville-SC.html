<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair in Greenville SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the service technicians believed they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
