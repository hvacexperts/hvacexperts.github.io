<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air pollutant might likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
