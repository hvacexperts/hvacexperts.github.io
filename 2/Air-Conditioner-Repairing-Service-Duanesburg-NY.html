<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Duanesburg NY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
