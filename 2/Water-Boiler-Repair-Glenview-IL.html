<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed problems. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
