<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Richlands NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in explaining what services would be performed.
