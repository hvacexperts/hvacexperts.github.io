<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
