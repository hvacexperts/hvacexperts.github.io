<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them.

PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
