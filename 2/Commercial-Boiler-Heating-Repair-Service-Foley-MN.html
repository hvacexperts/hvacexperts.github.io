<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Incorrectly situated outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
