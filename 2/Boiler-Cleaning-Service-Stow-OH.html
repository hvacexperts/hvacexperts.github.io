<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, smoking cigarettes, family products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to select items that will prevent indoor air issues from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood products. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it ends up being wet.<p>
