<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the results kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too restricted to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could happen.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents.
