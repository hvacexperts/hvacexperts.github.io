<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Union WA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be inspected a minimum of two times per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
