For instance, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective.
