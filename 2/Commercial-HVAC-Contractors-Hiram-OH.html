Due to these factors, the job growth for this profession is greater than average.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by just using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified agent from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the air conditioning system.

<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air.
