<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
