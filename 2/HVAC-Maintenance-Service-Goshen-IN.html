<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (particularly during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the stores vary beyond an acceptable range that might prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
