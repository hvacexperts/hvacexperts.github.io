<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Climax NC</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a consistent temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
