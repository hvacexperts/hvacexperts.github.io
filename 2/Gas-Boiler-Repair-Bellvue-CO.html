There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
