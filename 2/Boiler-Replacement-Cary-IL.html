And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

But more complex problems-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the three tactics below may be appropriate.<p>
