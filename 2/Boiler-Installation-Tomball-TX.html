<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Tomball TX</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
