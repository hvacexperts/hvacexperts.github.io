<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
