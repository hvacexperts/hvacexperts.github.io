It takes about six months of close observation to see how frequently your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right decision on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll need to clean them.
