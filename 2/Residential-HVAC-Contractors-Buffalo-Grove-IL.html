<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate.
