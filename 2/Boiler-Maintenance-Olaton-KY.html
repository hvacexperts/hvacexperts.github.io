<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
