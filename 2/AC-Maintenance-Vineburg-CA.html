<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>If you want to conserve yourself time and money over the long term, having yearly maintenance performed on the furnace is an excellent concept.
