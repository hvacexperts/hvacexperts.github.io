POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
