<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time.

In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
