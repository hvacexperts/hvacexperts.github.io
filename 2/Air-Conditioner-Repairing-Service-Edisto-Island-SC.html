<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Edisto Island SC</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
