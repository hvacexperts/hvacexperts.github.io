<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and effective  technique to reduce ambient air contamination and possible health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.)
