<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
