<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
