<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information may recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
