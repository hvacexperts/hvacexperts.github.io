<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
