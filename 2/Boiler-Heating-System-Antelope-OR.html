<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>

Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can likewise generate air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.
