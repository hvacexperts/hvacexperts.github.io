<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
