As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
