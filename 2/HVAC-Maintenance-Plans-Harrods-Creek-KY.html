<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-410a and r-404a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
