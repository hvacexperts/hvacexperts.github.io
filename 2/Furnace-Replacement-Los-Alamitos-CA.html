The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have become fairly proficient at researching items on line prior to purchasing them. Nevertheless I don't discover that there is a central area for browsing information about the "true" value of house HVAC systems or maybe I ought to say a truthful assessment of these items. Because they are truly taxed in the summer season, given that I live in FL it is crucial to have a good AC system in your house.<p>
