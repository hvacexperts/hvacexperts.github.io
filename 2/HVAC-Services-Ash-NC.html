<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by offering an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
