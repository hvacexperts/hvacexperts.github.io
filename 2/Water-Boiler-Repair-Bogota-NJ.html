<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects throughout summertimes. The best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are inspected and cleaned completely prior to colder seasons begin. Always be sure that the furnace is tidied up every year to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working appropriately. If your furnace is in an extremely poor condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking about purchasing a brand-new one.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
