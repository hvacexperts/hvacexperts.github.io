<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
