<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
