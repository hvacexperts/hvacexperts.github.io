<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system.
