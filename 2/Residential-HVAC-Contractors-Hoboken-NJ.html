For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a really advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
