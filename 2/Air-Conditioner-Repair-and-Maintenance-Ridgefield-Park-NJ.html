<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a few years earlier.<p>
