<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
