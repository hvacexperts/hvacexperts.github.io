<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that most Seattleites will just use sparingly, however since heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

If a heatpump remains in your future, the very best time to install cooling in your house may very well be when your heating system breaks down.<p>

Due to the fact that overly damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can impact allergic people, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
