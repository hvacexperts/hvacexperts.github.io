<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system.
