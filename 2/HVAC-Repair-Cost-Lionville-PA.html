<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Lionville PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.
