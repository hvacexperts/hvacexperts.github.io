<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When a business compartmentalizes like this, it can further increase effectiveness, cut unnecessary costs, and increase revenues. When you do this, you should be able understand what the sales are in each department, what the cost of sales and overhead expenses are in each department, and what the net revenue is for each department. From here you can execute systems that allow you to take house more earnings at the end of the day.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
