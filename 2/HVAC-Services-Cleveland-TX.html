<h3>Home Furnace in Cleveland TX</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
