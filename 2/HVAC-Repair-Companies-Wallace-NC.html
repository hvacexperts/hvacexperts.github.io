<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
