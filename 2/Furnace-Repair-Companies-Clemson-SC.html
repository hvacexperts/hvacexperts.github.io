If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms.

If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative ought to ask for that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
