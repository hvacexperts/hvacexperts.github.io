<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>
