<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.)

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
