<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
