<h3>Furnace Replacement in Murrieta CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the go to. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the evaluation on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have found out how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow.
