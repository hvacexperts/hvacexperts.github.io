<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
