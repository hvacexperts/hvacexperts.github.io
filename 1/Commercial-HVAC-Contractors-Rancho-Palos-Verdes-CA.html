<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

You might associate that lemony or piney scent with a clean kitchen or clean synthetic scents in laundry items and air fresheners release lots of various chemicals into the air.
