<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Etlan VA</h3>

Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
