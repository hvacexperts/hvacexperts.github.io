<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized.

However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same).

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you have to do it frequently, it's probably time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
