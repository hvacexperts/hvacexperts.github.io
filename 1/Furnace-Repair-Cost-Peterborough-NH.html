Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact.

Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.
