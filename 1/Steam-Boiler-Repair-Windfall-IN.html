<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
