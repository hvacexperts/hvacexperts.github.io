<h3>Commercial HVAC in Grover SC</h3>
<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air may also be an issue.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Switch off the power.
