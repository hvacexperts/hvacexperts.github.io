<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other offices is important not just for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific diseases have actually been linked to particular air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate signs but can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness.

An unexpected shift in temperature from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
