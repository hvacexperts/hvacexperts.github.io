<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
