<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
