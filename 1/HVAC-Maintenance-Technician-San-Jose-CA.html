We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same.

Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and cure-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
