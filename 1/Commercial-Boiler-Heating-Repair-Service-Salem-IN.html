<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
