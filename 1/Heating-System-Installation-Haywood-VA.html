<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply.

By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
