<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
