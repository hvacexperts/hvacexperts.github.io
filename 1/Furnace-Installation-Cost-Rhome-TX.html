<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
