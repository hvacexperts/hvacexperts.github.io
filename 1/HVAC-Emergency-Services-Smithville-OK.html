<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Smithville OK</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
