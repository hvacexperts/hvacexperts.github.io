If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in small quantities is not hazardous, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they may spread throughout the entire office or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
