Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a restroom flooring or be set up across the whole sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are usually used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
