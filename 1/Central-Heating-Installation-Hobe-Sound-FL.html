<p>When setting up the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running numerous yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite pricey.

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and dependable  source of energy.<p>
