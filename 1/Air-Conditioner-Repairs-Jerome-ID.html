<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw.
