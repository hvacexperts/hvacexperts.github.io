<p>A split ac system consists of 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet system. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split ac system rely on a set of pipelines to connect the outside to the inside air unit which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split air conditioning system installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to create either heated or cold air.<p>
<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Clayton IN</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stagnant air might also be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the variety of workers in the area.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely vital to keeping an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers.

Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and normally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
