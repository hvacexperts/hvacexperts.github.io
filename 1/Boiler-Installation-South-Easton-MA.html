<p>Some health results might show up shortly after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures to a contaminant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are treatable and normally short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Not long after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might appear, be aggravated or intensified.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
