<p>If you have a large home, a home with high ceilings, a house with many windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or normal home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
