<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
