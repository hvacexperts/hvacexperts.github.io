<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Travelers Rest SC</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow.

In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
