<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air issues as single-family houses due to the fact that many of the pollution sources, such as the interior building products, home furnishings, and family products, are similar. Indoor air issues comparable to those in offices are brought on by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, poorly positioned outside air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<p>Similar to the majority of home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heater can vary widely based upon the size of the home. Many furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
