<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heating system, you might try to find a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
