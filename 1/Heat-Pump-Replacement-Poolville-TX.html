That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
