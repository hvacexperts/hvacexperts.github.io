<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
