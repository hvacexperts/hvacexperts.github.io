In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
