<p>Expert heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
