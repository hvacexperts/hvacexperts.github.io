<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and infections, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products.

For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
