Improper change, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you buy a new gas range or variety. Never use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
