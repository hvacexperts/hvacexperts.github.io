<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
