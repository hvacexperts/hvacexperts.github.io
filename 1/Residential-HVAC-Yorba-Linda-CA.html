<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Clogged up rain gutters can lead to water leaking into the house, causing mold development, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow essentially anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your house. Direct exposure to high levels of home mold may set off mold allergy symptoms.
