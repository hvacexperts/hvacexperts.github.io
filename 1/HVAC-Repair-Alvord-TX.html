<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
