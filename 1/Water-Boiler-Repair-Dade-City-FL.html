<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>If your ac system is old, think about buying an energy-efficient design.
