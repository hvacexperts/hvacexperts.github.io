<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
