<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is truthful, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
