<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are many other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, however cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the current system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
