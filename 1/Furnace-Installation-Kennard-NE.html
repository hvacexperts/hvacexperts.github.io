<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
