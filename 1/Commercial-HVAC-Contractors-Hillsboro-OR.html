<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
