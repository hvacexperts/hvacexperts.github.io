<h3>Air Conditioner Repairing Service in Cullom IL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older system.<p>
