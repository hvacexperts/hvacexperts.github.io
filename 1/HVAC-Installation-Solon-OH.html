<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
