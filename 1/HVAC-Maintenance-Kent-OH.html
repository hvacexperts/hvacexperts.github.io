<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
