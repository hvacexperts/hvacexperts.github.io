<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
