<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
