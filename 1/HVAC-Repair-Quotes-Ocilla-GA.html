<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
