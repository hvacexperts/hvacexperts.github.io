<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
