<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
