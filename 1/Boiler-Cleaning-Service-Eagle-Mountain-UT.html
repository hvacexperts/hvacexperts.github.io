<h3>Central Heat And Air Units in Eagle Mountain UT</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
