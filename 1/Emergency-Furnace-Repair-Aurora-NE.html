<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
