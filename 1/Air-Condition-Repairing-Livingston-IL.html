<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Livingston IL</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
