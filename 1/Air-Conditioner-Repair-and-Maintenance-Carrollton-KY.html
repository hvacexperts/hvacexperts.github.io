<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
