<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Preservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
