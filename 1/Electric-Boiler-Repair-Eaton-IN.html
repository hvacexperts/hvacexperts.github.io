Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
