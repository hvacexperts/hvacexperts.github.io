Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
