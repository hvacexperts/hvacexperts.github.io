The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step.

Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
