<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>It is particularly essential to take as much of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather condition authorizations.<p>
