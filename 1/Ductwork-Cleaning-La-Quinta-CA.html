<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in La Quinta CA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
