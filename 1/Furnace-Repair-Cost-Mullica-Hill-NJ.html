<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
