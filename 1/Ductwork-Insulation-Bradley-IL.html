<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters.

For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
