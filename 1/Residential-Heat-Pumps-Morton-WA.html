<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
