<p>Some health results may appear soon after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or intensified.<p>
<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your home.
