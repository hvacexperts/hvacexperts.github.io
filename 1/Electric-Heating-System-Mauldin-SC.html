<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a really efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided remarkable, individualized, mindful, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, appealing and effective. He clearly and completely discussed all issues and fixes in a manner that made me confident in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a momentary fix to a problem that could not be dealt with on the first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
