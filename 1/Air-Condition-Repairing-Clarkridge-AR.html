<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years.
