These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities.
