<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
