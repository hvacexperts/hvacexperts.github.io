<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
