<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
