<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
