<h3>Central Heating Systems in Sierra Madre CA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find a sincere AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the issue and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they concern perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the present one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
