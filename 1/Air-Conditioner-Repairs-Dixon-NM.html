<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
