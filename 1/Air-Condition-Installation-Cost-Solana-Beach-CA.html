<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new furnaces can heat your house.

<p>Just an expert can accurately identify why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears weird or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Likewise, if the process does not work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you have to do it frequently, it's probably time for an expert opinion.<p>
