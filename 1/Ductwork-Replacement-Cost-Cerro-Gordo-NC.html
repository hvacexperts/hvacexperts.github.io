<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
