<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>After installing a brand-new furnace, consider pairing it with indoor air quality items to create a healthy and safe house.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
