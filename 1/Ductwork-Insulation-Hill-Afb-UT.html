<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outside unit.

However, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not simple, since it considers not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied great customer care at the end of the consultation by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally greater than lots of heatpump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending on the model you acquire.

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
