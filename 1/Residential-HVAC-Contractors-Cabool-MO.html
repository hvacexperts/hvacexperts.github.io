<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their performance with time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
