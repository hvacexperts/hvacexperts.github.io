<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
