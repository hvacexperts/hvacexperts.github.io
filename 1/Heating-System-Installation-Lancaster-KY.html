<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my things. I like my devices and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs.

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
