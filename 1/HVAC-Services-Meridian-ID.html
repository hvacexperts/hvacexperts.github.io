<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems in Meridian ID</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
