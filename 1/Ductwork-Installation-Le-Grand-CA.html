<h3>AC Replacement Service in Le Grand CA</h3>
<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Le Grand CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
