<p>Streamline your services, earn more services revenue, and provide an amazing client experience. To ensure the unit you select is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we don't just change it with the exact same size system you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Filtration need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
