<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, cruel summertime.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
