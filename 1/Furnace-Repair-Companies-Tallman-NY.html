<p>We take a look at hints prior to we supply guidance to change rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.
