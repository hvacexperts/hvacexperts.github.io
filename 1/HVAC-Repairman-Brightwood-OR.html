<p>Furnaces resemble cars. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below zero night.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and useful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating system and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these substantial however minor changes in his quote. Because of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
