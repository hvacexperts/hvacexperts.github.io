<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
