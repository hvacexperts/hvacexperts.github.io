<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Specialists suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, considering current changes in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
