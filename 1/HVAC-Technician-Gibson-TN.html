<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
