<p>UW trainees, visitors and staff members must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform different activities. , if the air quality is bad it can impact a person's productivityConvenience health, and comfort.Performance The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to provide and maintain healthy and comfy environments free of contaminants. A crucial part of the program is reacting to and solving issues of building occupants about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your home appropriately. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into account when purchasing a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will considerably affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>

So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
