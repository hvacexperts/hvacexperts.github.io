<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
