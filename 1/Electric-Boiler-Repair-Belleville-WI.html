<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and keep.<p>
