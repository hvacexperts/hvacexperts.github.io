<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air investigations it has actually conducted. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be real. These investigations exposed that proper ventilation is important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
