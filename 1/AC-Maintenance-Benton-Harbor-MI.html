<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can also be connected to a gadget known as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
