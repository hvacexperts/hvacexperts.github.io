<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
