<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
