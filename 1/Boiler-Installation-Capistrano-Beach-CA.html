<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level.

<p>Together with these weather modifications, we've also been the nation's fastest growing city over the last years, adding well over 100,000 people, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In the majority of areas of our country, a/c is a standard requirement, meaning the people that move here from out of state are likely anticipating to have cooling.

This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
