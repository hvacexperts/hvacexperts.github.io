<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Yoder IN</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be set up in all kitchen areas and restrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most efficient fans are quiet and long lasting. Usage fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for an enough time period. A great general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
