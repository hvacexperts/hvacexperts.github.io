<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Micro NC</h3>
<p>Concentrating on commercial and residential a/c installation, Around the Clock Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. is dedicated to keeping clients in Rye Brook, NY nice and cool. No task is too huge or little, and we intend to provide total client fulfillment on every project we carry out. We likewise provide a wide choice of air conditioner designs at inexpensive prices to satisfy your particular needs.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
