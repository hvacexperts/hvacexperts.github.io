<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room.
