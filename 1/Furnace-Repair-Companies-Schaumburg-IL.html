Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>

Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
