<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace since it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
