<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system.
