<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
