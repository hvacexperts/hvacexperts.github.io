<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them up until they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
