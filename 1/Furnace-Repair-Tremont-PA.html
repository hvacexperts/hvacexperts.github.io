<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold development and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in covert or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
