<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops ought to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
