<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>To establish a safe assessment or consultation with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your location in an online search. Message or call service technicians to ask whether they can perform an assessment over the phone or even over a video call. This way, they can examine the problem without increasing the danger of virus transmission by visiting your home.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction furnishings, carpets and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex concerns-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies below might be appropriate.<p>
