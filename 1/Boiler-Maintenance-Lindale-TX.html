<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those measurements on hand when looking for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning system: Don't place it in an egress window that serves as the only methods of escape should a fire appear.<p>
