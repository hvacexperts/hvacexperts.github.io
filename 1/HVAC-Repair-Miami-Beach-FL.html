<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course. A basic a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
