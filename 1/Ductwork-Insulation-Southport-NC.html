<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
