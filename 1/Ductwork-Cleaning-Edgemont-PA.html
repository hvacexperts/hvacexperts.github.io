<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Edgemont PA</h3>
<p>You depend on your ac system to cool you cool when temperatures outside start to warm up. However in order to preserve a comfortable indoor environment, you need every element of your cooling system to be working its best. So if your unit requires a new compressor, rely on our group for help. At Around the Clock Cooling & Heating, Inc., we supply reliable cooling compressor installation services for residential and commercial customers in Rye Brook, NY.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
