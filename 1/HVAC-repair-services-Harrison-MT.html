<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
