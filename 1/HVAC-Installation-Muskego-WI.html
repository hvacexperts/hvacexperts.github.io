<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
