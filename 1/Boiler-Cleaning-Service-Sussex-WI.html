The companies were not made aware they were part of a research study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or approaches used. The EPA research study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller variety of homes.

<p>A geothermal heating system is more dependable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunlight to work effectively.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
