<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at San Bernardino CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Don't stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just might require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital display screen on. If 24 volts isn't obtained, you'll get a blank screen. There are many different reasons why your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be talking about why you may be having difficulty with your Nest smart thermostat. Examine your emergency breakers initially. You must have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Examine if you have the correct 120 volts of power going to the furnace. In some cases the furnace switch is mistakenly turned off by somebody going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that sometimes goes defective. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are lots of wires in your furnace.<p>
