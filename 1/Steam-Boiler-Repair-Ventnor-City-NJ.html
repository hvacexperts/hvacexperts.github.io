<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are hardly ever utilized due to long-term corrosive issues. Virtually all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, won't rust and comes in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
