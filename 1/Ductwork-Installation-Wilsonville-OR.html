<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Wilsonville OR</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
