<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room air conditioning system. In addition, they run out the method, quiet, and practical to run.
