<p>In general, ductless AC systems are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than conventional A/cs. This is because you can turn off individual spaces when you're not occupying them.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when shopping for an air conditioning unit to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to set up the a/c unit: Do not place it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape ought to a fire erupt.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
