<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Your questions or concerns about indoor air issues can regularly be responded to by the government companies in your state or local government. Responsibilities for indoor air quality problems are usually divided among various agencies. Calling or composing the firms accountable for health or air quality assurance is the best way to start getting info from your state or local government. To get state firm contacts, call or write EPA's IAQ Info Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
