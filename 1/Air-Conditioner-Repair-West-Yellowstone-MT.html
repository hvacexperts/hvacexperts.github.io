<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if required, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs.
