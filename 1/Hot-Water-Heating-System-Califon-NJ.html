<p>As noted, improper temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation might likewise contribute to employee health problems. Temperature level levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%.

<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building materials, home furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, but much of the danger also comes from burning things.
