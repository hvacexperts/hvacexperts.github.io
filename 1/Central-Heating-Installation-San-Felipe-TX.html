<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and infants are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids may have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
