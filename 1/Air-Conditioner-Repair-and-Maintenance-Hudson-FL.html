<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
