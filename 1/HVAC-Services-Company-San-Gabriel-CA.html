<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
