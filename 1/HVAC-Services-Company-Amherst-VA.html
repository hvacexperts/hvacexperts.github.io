<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
