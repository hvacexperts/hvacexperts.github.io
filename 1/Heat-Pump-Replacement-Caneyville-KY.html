<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
