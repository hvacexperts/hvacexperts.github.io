<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Davidson NC</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have significant, damaging impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of toxins might be 2 to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect modification, frequently shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or variety. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
