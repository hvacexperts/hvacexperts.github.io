<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
