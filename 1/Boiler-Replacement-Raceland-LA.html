<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Raceland LA</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and purchased this Carrier and I must state it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool down your home which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
