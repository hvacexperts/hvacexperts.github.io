<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The EPA recommends that you have your air ducts inspected by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician discovers that your air ducts have substantial mold, dust, dirt, and other impurities or a musty odor, they may recommend duct cleaning This is specifically crucial if somebody in your home has asthma, allergies, or other signs that may be associated with indoor air pollution.<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States."

Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
