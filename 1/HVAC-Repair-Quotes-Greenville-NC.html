An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution.
