<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
