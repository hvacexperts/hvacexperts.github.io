<p>As with many home improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ commonly based on the size of the home. Many heaters will last between 15 and twenty years.

A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>

In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
