<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter once every three months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
