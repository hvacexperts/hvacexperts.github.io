<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
