<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
