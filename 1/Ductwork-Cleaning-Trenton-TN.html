<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
