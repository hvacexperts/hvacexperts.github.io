These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Specialists advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
