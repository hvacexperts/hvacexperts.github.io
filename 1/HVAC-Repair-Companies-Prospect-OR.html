<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
