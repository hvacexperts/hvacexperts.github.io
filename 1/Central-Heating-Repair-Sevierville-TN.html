<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
