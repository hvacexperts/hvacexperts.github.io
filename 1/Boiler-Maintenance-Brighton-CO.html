<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate.

Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
