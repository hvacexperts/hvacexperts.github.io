For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
