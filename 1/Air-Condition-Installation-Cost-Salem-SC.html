The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis.
