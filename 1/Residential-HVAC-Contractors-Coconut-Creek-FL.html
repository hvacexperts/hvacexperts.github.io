<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Coconut Creek</h2>

In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
