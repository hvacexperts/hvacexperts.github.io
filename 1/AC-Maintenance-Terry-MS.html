<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
