<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
