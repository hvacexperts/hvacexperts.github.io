However, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-lived indoor air quality issue is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more intricate issues-- identified by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three techniques listed below might be suitable.<p>
