<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. Sometimes, the furnace will just run more difficult to keep a warm environment for your home when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact among our professionals if you need clearness on this concern.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild effects that are often mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, queasiness, tiredness and disorientation. The impacts of CO direct exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
