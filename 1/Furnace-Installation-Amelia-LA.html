Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
