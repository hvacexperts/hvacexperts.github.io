<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
