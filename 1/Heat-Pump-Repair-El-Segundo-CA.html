<h3>Gas Central Heating in El Segundo CA</h3>
<p>Heating systems are appliances whose function is to create heat (i.e. warmth) for the building. This can be done through central heating Such a system consists of a furnace, boiler, or heat  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central area such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical room in a large structure. The heat can be transferred by radiation, convection, or conduction Space heaters are used to heat single spaces and just include a single unit.<p>
<p>The technological improvements in heating equipment have actually been improving year after year. Boilers and heaters now utilize less fuel to provide heat and hot water, are much easier to maintain, and are also smaller sized and quieter.
