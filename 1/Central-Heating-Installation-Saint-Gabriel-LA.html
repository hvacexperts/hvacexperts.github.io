<p>In-floor heater can include certain health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this issue due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Moreover, considering that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can reduce the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
