<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning unit: Do not position it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heater in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive alternative, but more recent systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly efficient gas heaters can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
