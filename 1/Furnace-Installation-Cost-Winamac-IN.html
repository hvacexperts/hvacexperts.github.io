<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
