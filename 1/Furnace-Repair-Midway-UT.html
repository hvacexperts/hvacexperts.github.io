<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Lots of individuals are becoming more mindful and concerned about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including irritants and contaminants can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Periodically it needs to be eliminated to boost and refresh the quality of indoor air and improve the cooling. Beacon Pipes, Seattle, WA cleans the duct physically by eliminating the debris from the air filter.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
