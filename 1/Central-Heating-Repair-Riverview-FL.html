<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Your furnace has numerous elements that can impact the health and wellness of you and your liked ones. Having a total check of your furnace will offer guarantee that it is safe to run.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company should examine measurements of temperature level, humidity and air flow. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for constructing use and occupancy) must be performed. A structure walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings might be useful. Leakages need to be eliminated.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
