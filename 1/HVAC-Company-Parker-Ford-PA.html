<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
