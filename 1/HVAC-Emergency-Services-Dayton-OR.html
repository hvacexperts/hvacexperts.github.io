<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
