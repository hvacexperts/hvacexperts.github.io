<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the ac system is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

Soil by roads and highways might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to clean your feet before getting in the home. Change your clothes before you go home and clean these clothes independently if you work with lead in your job or a pastime.

<p>Geothermal heating is among the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Because the energy used to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground, it safeguards the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
