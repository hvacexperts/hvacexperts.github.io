<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

The competence of lots of other people such as health and safety or building maintenance personnel, and the experience of everyone in the office will all be very important in finding the origin of your IAQ issue.<p>
