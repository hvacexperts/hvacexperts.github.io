<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room.
