<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
