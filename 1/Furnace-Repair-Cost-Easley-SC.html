<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
