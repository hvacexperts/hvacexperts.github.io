<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
