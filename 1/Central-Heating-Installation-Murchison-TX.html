<p>Some health effects can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality problem, especially if they appear after an individual transfers to a new home, remodels or refurnishes a house, or treats a home with pesticides. If you think that you have signs that might be associated with your house environment, discuss them with your doctor or your local health department to see if they might be caused by indoor air contamination.

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor.
