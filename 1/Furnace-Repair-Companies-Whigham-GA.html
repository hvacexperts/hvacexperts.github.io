The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years.
