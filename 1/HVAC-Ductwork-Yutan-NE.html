<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
