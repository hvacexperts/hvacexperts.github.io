<p>In many cases, if products have actually stopped working to dry out several days after the thought water occasion, mold growth is thought within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them..
