However, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
