<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. There are several design methods in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A/c producers generally make rugged, high quality products. Start by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
