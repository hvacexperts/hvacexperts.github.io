<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
