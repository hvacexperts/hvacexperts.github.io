<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
