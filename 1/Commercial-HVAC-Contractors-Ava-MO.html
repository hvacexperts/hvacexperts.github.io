<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
