<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Galena</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However a number of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
