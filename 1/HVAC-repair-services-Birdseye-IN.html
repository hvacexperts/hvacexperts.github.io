Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could try to find and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all taken place during Thanksgiving week!

<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
