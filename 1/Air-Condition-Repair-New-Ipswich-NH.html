<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in New Ipswich NH</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>If you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, plan on investing several thousand dollars for the total system.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be confused.
