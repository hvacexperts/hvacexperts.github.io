After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Considering that 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Advancement (HUD) has actually permitted only using plywood and particleboard that comply with specified formaldehyde emission limitations in the building and construction of upraised and mobile houses. In the past, a few of these homes had raised levels of formaldehyde due to the fact that of the large amount of high-emitting pushed wood products used in their construction and due to the fact that of their fairly little interior space.<p>
