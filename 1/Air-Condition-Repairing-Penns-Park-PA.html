<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
