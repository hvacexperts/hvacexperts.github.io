<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
