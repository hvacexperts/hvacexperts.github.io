<p>Additionally, clean and even vacuum constantly in the area where your heating unit is positioned. Despite the fact that you might believe that clearing the space of all items that might catch fire sooner or later provides enough security, often other junk such as lint and dust may collect inside the furnace which might cause a fire. Too much lint and dust will also obstruct your filter faster than it should be which will be a blow to your spending plan as you will need to replace the equipment or repair.<p>
