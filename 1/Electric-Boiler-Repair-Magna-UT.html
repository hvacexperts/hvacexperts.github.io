<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
