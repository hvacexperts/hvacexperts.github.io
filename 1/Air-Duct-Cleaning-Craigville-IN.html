<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
