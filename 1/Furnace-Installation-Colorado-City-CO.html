<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
