Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
