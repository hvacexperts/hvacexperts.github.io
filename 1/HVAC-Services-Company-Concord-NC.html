<h3>Furnace Repair in Concord NC</h3>

The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.
