<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized.

<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged.

We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
