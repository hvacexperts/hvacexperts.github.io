<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
