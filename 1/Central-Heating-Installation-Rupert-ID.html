<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Rupert ID HVAC Company</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
