<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
