All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again.
