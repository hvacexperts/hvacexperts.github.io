Because they just partly remove the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these devices is uncertain. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reputable means of reducing the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides more details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
