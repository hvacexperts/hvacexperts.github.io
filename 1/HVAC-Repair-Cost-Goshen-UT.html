<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Goshen UT</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floors rather than the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.
