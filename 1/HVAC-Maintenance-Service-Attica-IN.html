<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
