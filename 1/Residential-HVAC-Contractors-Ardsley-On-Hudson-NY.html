<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
