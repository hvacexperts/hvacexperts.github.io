<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Anna TX</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely. Modification the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned because the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness with time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
