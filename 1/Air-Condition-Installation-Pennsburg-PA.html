<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
