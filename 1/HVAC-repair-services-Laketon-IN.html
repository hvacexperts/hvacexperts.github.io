<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside is related to a greater occurrence of resident respiratory problems.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Laketon IN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
