<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>It is especially crucial to take as much of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
