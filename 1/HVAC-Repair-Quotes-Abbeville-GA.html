<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>

While an area heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
