<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
