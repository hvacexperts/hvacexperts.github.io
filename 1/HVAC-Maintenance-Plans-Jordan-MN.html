In damp or warm environments, maintaining thermal comfort exclusively by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also utilize outside air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Jordan MN</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
