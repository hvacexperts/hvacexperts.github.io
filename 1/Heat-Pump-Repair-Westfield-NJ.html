<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
