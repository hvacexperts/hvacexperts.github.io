<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.

Some companies offer priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor.
