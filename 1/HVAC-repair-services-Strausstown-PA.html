<h3>Commercial HVAC in Strausstown PA</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
