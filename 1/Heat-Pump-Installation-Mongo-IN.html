<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
