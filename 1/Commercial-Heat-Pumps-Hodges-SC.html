(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
