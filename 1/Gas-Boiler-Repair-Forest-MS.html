<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
