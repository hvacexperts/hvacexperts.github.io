<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
