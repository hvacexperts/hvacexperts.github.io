<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and should be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in covert or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
