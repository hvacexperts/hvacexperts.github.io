<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Fort Thomas KY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
