<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
