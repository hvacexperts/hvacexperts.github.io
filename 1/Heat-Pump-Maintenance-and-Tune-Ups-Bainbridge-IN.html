<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c unit may end up being extremely unclean.

This is an outstanding chance to determine parts that are worn or defective. Changing them to fix the a/c may be a lot cheaper when the issue is relatively small.<p>
