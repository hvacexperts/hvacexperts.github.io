<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit will not be able to cool your house properly. These are just a few of the factors that you require to take into consideration when looking for a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will considerably affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
