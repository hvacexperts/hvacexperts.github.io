<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy.
