<h3>Furnace Cost in Montgomery IL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
