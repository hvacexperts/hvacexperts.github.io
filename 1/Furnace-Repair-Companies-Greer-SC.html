<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Greer SC?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>First make sure the air filter is tidy and in great condition if you see a decline in heat output. Next, inspect other elements of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, debris and dust, an affordable fix that can help improve efficiency. Likewise, examine the vents and ducts for blockage. Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and positioned correctly.

Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house sensation cold if this occurs. You may also need to inspect your insulation to make sure that warm air does not leave from your area through different openings.<p>
