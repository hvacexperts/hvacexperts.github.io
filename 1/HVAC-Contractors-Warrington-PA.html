<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Warrington PA</h3>
<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically challenging to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to focus on the time and place signs happen. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the area, for example, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread inside your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
