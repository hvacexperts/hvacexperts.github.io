<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
