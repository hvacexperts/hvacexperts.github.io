<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
