<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in New Century KS</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us for that reason. Generally they were at first interested in from another location monitoring some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and carried out indoor air quality keeping track of to provide a healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative consequences connected with indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
