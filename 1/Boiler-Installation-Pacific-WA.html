Such details can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this information may determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
