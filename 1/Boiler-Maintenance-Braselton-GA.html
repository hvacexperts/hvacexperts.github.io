<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
