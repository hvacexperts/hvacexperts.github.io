In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
