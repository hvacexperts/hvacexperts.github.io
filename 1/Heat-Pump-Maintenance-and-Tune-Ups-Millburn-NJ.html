<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy.

Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture inside your home is associated with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
