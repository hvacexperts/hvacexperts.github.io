<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
