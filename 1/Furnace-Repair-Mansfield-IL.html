<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
