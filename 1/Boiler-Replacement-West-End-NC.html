<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
