<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and readily available source of energy.<p>
