Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
