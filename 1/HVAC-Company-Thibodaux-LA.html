<p>A/c can produce a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heater can also be linked to a device referred to as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat created from the ground source heat pump compressor and uses it to heat water. This implies that this device can also offer totally free hot water for domestic usage in addition to its standard geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
