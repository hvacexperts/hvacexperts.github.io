<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Mojave CA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and very well done. The installers were respectful and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge easily people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on detail that creates a task extremely well done. I really highly suggest the 2 gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
