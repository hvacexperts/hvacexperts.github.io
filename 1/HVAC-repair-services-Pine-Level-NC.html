<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged.

We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
