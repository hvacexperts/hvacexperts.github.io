We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
