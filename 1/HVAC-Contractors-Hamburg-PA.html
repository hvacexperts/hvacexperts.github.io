<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
