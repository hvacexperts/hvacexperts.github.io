<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
