Depending on the type of system set up, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and devices may need special permits, and there is limited versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
