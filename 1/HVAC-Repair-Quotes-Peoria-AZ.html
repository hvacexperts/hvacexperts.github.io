<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
