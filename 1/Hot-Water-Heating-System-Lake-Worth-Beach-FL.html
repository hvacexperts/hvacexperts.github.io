<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
