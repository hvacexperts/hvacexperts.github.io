<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat moved heat to other short articles in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>

After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main problem in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has performed.

These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical power. The two operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
