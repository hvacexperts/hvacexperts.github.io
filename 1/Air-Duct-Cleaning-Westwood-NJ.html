<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
