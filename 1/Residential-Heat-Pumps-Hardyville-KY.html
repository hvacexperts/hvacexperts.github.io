<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

Likewise they identified the issue and fixed very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
