<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Monett MO</h3>
<p>I was very delighted in the start since things ran efficiently with no noise. Additionally, I saw visible changes in my electricity expenses. After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it examined and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. However then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
