<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Campobello SC?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper modification, typically indicated by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a new gas stove or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
