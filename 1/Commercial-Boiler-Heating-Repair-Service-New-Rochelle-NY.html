<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
