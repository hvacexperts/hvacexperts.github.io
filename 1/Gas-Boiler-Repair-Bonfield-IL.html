<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects throughout summers. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating system burners are examined and cleaned up completely before chillier seasons start.

<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
