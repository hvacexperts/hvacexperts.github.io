<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heat pump is an affordable option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
