<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
