<p>This in floor heating unit includes one thin continuous cable television heating element woven into a mat that you set up under the tile.

<p>My eldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
