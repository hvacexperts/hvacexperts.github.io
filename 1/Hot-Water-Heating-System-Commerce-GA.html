<p>Specialist heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
