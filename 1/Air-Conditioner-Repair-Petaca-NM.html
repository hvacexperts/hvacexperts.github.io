Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
