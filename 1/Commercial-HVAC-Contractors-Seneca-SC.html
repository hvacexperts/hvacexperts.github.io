<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Seneca SC?</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source systems. The lack of moving parts suggests you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
