<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if required, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs.
