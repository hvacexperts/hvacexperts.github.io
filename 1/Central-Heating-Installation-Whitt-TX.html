<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
