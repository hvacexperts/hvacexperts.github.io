<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
