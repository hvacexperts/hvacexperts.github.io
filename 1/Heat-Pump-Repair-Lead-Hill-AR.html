<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
