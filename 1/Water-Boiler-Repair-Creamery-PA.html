<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
