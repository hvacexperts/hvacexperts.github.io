<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
