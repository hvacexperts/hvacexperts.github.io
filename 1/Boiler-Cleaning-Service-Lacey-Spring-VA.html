<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Lacey Spring VA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
