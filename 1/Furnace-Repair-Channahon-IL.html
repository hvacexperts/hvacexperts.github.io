<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Channahon IL</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as various as the different houses they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile homes, homes, high-rise condominiums, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), correct purification, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is running safely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
