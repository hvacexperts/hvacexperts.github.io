<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
