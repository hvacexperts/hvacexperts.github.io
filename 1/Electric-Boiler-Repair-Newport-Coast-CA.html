<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
