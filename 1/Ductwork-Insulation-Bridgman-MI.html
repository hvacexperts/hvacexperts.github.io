<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be efficiently identified or corrected without a comprehensive building investigation. These examinations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building private investigators evaluate the history of resident signs and structure operation procedures. In many cases, these questions might rapidly discover the problem and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
