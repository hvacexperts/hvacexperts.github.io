<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors remove impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
