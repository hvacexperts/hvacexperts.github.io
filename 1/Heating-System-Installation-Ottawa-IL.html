<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>

Nevertheless, these illness can likewise be traced to microbes that grow in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, senior people, and individuals with breathing issues, allergies, and lung illness are especially susceptible to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to identify if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a specific requirement.
