<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to choose items that will avoid indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are pointed out here. Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider utilizing strong wood products. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
