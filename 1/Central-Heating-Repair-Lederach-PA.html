<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
