<p>While pollutants typically found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. Individuals likewise react really differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Further research is required to better comprehend which health results occur after direct exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in houses and which take place from the higher concentrations that take place for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
