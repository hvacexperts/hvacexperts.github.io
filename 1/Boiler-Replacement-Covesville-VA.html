<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside is related to a higher occurrence of resident breathing problems.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is enabled to rise and stream out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, but care must be required to ensure convenience. In humid or warm climates, maintaining thermal comfort exclusively by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
