<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
