<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
