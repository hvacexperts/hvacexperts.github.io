A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to manage, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can shorten its life.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
