<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Dana Point CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from a service or seller to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed individual to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system. A voided guarantee won't do you any good need to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
