<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
