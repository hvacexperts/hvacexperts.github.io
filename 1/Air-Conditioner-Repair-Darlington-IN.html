<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all components of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
