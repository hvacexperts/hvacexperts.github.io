<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers at Martin GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
