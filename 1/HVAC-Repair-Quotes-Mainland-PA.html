<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
