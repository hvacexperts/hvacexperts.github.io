<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
