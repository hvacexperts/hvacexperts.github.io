<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace at Centreville VA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
