<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation business completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

These factors include bad ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. Often, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas with time) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
