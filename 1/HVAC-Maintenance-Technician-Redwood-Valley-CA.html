<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
