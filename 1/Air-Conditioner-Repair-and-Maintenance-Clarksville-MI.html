<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually managed the one repair I needed well, and are expert and constantly on-time.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
