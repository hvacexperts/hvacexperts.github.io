<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Ashby MA</h3>
<p>Even more recent furnaces less than 5 years of ages have been found as bad. Too many property owners are surprised to learn that their 'new' furnace  heat exchanger. Sometimes it is due to bad furnace design, but in a lot of cases, it's from disregard. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Assessment of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which look for debris on the burners, bad airflow, and an unclean filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as required. The Performance Check-Up (see previous answer above) is likewise crucial to your furnace's life expectancy.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
