<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
