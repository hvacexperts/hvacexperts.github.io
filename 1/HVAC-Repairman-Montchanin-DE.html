<p>Expert heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts advise following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
