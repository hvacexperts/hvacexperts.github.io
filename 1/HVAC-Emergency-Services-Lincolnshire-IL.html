There are numerous methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
