<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
