<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system makers generally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool off for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.
