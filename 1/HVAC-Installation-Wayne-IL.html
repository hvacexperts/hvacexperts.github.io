The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
