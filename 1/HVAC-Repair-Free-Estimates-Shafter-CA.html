<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the suggested connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with issues. I would advise this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.
