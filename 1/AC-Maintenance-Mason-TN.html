<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
