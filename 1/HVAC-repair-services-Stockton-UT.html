<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
