<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be performed in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
