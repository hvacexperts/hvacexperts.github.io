<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
