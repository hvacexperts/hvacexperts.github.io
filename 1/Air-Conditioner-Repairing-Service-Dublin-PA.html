<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.
