We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>

<p>Air flow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure distinctions created by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>Regularly, however, investigators will need to come to the building to carry out individual interviews with occupants, to look for possible sources of the problems, and to inspect the style and operation of the ventilation system and other building functions.
