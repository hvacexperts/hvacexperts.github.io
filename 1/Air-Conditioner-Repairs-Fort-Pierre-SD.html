<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
