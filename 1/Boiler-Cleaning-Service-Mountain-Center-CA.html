<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
