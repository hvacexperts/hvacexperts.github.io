<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening.

Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
