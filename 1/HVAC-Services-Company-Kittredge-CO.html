<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
