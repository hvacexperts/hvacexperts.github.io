<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
