<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Glorieta NM</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very comprehensive in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn provided excellent customer service at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>

According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely efficient natural gas heaters can accomplish AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
