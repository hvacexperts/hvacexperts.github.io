<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Tygh Valley OR</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.
