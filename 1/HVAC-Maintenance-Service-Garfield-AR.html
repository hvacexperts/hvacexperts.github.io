<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
