<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
