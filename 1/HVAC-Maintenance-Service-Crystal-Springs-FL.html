Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up.
