<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.
