<h3>AC Maintenance in Alpharetta GA</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
