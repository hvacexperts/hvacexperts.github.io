<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of ac system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and maintain.<p>
