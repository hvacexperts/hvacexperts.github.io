The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the floorings, ceilings and walls warmed. In turn, the objects in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
