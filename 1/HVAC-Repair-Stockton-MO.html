For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation.
