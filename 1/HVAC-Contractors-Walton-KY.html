<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down totally.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
