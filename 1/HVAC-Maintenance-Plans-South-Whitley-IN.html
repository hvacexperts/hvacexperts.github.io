<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a method that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
