<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>As you generally need to use a self-leveling substance on top of the electric underfloor heating unit, you need to consider the time it takes for this to completely dry before the flooring covering can be put in place - this is usually a day or 2.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead.
