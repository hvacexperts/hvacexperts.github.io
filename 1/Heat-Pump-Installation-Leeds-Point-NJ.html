<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
