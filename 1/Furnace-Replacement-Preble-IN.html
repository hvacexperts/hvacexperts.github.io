<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã A lot of furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnÃ¢ $ t appropriately detected, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed.
