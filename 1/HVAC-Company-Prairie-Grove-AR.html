<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
