<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow limitation will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
