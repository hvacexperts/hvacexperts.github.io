<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the necessary electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
