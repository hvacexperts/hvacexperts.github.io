<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
