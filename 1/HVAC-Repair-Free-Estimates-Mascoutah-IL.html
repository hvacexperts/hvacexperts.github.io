<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
