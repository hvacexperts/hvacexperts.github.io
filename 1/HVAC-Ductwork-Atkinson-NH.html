<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Since an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy.
