<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
