<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Fort Myers FL</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ issue. Your employer should examine measurements of humidity, temperature level and air circulation. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to ensure it is working according to specifications for developing usage and tenancy) need to be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be helpful. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning units, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with germs or fungis and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure tenancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these illness do disappoint up until many years after direct exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothing and equipment brought house from task websites.<p>
