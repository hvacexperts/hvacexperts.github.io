The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
