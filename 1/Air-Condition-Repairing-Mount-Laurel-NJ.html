<h3>Boiler Heating System in Mount Laurel NJ</h3>
<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was utilized in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Mobile houses are usually smaller sized than stick-built homes and utilize significantly less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat. Expect the average mobile home oil furnace to have beginning expenses of around $1,500. Bear in mind that not as many brands produce oil furnaces for this use, and you may discover more options with gas, propane, or electric furnaces.<p>
<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
