<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in Antelope OR</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
