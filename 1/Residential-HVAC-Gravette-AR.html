<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
