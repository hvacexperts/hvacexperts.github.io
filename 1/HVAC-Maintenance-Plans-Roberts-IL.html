Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any issues or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where suitable.<p>
