<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
