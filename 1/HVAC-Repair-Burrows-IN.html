<p>Specialist heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
