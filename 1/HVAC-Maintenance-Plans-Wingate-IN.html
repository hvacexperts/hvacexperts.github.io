<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Wingate IN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
