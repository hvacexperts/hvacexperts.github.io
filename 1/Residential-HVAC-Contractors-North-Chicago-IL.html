<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

Similarly Camryn offered fantastic customer care at the end of the visit by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the market.<p>
