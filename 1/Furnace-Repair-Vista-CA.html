<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
