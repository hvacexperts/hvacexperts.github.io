<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
