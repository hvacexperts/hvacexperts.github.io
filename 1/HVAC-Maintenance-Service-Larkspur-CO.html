<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
