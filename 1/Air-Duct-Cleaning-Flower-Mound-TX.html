He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.
