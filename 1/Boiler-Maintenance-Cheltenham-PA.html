<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Cheltenham PA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
