<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
