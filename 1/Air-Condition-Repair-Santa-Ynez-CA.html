<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Santa Ynez CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
<p>Great Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact.

We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
