<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, considering that it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
