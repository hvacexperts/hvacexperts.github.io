<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
