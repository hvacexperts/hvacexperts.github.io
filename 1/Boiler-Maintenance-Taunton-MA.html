Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
