<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
