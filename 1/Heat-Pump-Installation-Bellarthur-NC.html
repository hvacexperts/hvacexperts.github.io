<p>We take a look at hints prior to we offer guidance to change instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
