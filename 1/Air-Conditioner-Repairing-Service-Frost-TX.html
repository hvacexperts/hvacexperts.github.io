<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

This company introduced a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes.
