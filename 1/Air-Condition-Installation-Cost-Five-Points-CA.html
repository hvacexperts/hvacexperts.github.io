<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
