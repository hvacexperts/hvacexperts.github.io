<h3>HVAC Repair Companies in Iron Station NC</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
