<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>The most common kind of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive choice, but more recent systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient natural gas heating systems can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
