<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
