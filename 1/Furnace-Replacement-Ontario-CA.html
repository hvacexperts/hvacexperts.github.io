<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Ontario CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
