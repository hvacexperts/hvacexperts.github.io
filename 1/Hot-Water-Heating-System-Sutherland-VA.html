<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
