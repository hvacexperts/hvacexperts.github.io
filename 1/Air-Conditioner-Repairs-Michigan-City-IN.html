<h3>Ductwork Installation in Michigan City IN</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
