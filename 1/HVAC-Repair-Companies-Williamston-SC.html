<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to install, specifically in an older home. Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly adverse dust. Additionally, particular fuels and equipment may require unique permits, and there is limited flexibility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
