<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work development for HVAC service technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than two times the average for all occupations. A number of factors contribute to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older a/c systems to satisfy more stringent ecological regulations. The slow rebound in commercial and residential building will create a constant circulation of new opportunities, especially for service technicians who are willing to relocate.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
