<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Jacksonville TX</h3>
<p>In-floor heating unit can feature certain health benefits. The hotter the air, the drier it becomes. On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem. Additionally, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, registers and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can reduce the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
