<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
