<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil.

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
