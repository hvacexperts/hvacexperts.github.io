<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
