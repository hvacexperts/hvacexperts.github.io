<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter.
