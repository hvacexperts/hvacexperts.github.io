<p>We look at hints before we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
