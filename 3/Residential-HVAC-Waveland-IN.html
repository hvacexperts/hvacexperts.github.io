<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
