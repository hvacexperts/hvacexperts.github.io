<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
