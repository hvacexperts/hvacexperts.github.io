<p>We look at hints before we provide suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
