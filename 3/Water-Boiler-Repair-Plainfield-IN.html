The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.
