<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the trouble location in examining the bill. He dealt with the issue in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered fair prior to he recalled, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by providing an expert quote with options, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been shown to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no proof, nevertheless, that a reasonable variety of houseplants eliminate considerable amounts of contaminants in offices and houses. Because excessively damp soil might promote the development of microbes which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
