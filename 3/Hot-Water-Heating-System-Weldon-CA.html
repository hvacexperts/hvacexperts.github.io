<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
