<p>Equipment costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heating system. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to higher energy costs. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long run. Rates for gas furnaces range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric furnaces start at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
