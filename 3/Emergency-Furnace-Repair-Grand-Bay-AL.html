These convection heating systems are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

If your technician finds that your duct have substantial mold, dust, dirt, and other impurities or a moldy smell, they might advise duct cleaning This is particularly crucial if somebody in your home has asthma, allergies, or other symptoms that might be associated with indoor air contamination.<p>
