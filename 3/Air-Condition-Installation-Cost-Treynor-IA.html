<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
