<h3>Floor Heating System in Delray Beach FL</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
