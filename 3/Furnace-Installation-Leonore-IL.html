<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Leonore IL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
