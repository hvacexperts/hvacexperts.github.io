<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
