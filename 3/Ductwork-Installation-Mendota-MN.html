<h3>House Ventilation in Mendota MN</h3>

They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
