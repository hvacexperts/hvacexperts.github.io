<p>Brian was every bit truthful, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing professional discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, helpful and useful - his work was impressive!

We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are normally smaller than stick-built properties and use considerably less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat.

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to measure, as one action mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
