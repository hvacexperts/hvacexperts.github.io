<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
