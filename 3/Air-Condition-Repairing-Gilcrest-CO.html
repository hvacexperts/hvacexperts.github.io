<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Gilcrest CO</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales guy comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
