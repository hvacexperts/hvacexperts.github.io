<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may end up being clogged, minimizing air circulation quality, circulation, and volume. They also might end up being places for molds and bacteria to grow and be distributed throughout the home.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
