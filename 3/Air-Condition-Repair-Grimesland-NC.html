<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
