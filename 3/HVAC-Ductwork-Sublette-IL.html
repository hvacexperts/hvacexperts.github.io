<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
