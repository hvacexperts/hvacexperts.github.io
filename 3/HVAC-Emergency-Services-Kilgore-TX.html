<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
