Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite expensive. Installing a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>

<p>If you're trying to find an honest, hard-working, exceptionally trusted, & experienced cooling & heating contractor - give Around the Clock a call! I was originally referred to Ilan & his team by several of my next-door neighbors when I moved in 5+ years ago. I have them perform an annual tune-up & the numerous times I've needed a service call, Ilan was able always able to fit me in the very same day. They're terrific with the interactions - phone, text, e-mail! I put allot of value on a small business owner who lives in the neighborhood he services.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
