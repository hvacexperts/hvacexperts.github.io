<h3>Installation of HVAC in Redlands CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
