<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
