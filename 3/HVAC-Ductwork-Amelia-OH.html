<p>There is an essential balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores typically include greater price tags. So, ensure to decide based on how often you will use your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.

<p>Even more recent furnaces less than five years of ages have actually been found as bad. A lot of homeowners are surprised to discover that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger.

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
