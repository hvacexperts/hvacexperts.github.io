Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs.
