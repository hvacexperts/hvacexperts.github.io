<p>Collins Aerospace ventilation systems improve your flight experience by supplying fresh air, improving food security and cooling your flight-essential and flight-critical electronic devices. An alternative to packaged systems is the use of different indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and widely used around the world other than in The United States and Canada.
