The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house.

<p>Remember that the SEER score is computed using the exact same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summertime temperature to arrive at the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to come to the correct SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems produced in the United States.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
