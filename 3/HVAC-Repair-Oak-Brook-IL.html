<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a homeowner can require to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are discussed here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
