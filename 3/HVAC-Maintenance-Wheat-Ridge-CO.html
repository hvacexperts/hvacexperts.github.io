<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Wheat Ridge CO Home</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and assists tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
