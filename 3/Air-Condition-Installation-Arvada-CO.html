<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
