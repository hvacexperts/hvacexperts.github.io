<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
