<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep.
