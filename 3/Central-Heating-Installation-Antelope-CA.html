<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
