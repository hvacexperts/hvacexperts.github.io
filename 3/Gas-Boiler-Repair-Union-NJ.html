Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits.

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue.
