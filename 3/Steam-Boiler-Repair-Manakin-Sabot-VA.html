<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
