<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we recommend using our insulation boards. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money.

By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
