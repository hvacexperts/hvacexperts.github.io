<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
