<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is traditionally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
