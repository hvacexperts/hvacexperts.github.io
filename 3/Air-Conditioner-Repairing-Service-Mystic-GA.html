<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
