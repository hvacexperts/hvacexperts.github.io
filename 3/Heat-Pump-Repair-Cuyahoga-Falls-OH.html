<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

But more complex problems-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics listed below might be suitable.<p>
