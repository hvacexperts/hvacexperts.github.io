<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
