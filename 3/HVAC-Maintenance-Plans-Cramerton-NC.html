Usage fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for a sufficient amount of time.

For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
