This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
