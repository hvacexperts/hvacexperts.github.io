<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
