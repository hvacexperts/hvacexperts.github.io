<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimum efficiency and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will need to work harder and may overheat. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
