AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>New a/c generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating indicates greater energy performance and potentially lower energy expenses. A great SEER score for you depends on your house size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally permitted SEER rating is going to be far more energy effective than your present, old air conditioning system. It's not always about picking the design with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including infected soil tracked within, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>We have been extremely happy with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked effectively and is so effective that it substantially reduced our energy expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we have needed them for emergencies they reacted quickly and solved the issue.<p>
