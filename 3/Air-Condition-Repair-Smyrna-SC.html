<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Smyrna SC</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
