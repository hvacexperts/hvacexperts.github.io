<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While room a/c supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
