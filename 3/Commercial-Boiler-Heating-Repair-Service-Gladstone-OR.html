<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can exacerbate issues.
