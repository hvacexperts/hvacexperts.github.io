<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure.
