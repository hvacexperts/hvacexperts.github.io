<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
