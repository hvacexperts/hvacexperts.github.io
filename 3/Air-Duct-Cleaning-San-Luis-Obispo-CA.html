<p>Generally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
