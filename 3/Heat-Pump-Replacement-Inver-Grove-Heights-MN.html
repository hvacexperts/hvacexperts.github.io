<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
