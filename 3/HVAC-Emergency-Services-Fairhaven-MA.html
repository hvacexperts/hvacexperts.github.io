<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Fairhaven MA</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions need to also be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
