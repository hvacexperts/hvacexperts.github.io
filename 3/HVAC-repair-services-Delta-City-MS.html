<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
