<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
