<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
