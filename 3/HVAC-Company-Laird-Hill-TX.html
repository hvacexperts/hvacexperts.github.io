<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Laird Hill TX</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
