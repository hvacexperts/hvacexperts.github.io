<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of air conditioner, several main elements require to be considered. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any challenges en route of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit should also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply. It is extremely suggested to set up the a/c units in easily available places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
