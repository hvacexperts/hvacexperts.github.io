<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
