<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Morrow GA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
