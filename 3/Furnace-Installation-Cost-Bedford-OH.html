<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Bedford OH?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
