These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
