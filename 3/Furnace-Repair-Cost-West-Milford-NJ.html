<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
