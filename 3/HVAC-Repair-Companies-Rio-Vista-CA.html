<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed illness from exposure to clothing and equipment brought house from job sites.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to comprehend and preserve.<p>
