<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment buildings and large homes. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to tear and wear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
