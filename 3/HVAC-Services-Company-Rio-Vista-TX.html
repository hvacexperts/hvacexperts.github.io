<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
