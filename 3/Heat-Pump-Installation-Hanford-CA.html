<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
