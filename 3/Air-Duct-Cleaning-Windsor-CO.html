<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, causing holes and cracks. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.. a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
