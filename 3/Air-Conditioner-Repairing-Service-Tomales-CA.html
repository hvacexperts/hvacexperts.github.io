<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
