<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
