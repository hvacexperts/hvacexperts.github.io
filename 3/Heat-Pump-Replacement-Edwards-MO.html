Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
