<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
