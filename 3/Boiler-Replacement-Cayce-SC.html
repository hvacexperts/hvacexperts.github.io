<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others.

Heating systems that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the spaces dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
