<p>The first thing that you will in fact have to set up will be the air handler, which will be available in your central heating system installation package. This element is normally set up in the basement of your home, set off several feet from any concrete walls. When installing this part, make sure that the condenser drain is installed in such a way that it will be able to recede safely.<p>
<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
