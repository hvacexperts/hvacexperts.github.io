<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved problems. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require fairly little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional hot water heater.

The systems must be examined at least two times annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
