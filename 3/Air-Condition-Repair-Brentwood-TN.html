<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
