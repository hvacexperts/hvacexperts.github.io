<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
