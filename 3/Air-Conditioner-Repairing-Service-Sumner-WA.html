<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most affordable if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
