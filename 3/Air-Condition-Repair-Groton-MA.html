<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
