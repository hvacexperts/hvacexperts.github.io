Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
