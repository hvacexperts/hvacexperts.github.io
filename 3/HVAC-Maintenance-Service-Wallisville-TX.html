<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services used. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a producer's warranty. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's guarantee. However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
