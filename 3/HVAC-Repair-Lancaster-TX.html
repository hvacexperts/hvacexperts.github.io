<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
