<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes.
