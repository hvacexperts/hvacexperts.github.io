<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing.
