<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
