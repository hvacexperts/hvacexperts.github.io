<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
