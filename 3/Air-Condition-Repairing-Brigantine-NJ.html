<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear higher than typical, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system. New heating devices is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses immediately, not to point out the money you'll save money on repair expenses.

<p>Rising energy costs are not the only factor for high bills. Heaters often lose their effectiveness as they age, particularly if they have actually not been effectively maintained. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to supply the very same amount of heat. This will cause your energy bills to increase. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis could be utilized to help you pay for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
