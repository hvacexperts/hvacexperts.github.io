<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Kennewick WA</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To minimize pollutants, we suggest setting up sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to eliminate the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also help manage bacteria and natural odors. Most store-bought filters can not eliminate these tiniest of irritants and do not get rid of germs and gases.<p>
