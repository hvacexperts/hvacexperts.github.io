Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.
