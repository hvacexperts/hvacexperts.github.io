<h3>Furnace Installation in Southaven MS</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & decided to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were very professional, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had found the problem location in looking over the bill. He dealt with the issue in one day, had changed the expense to what I thought about fair before he called back, knew what may have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
