<p>The first air conditioners and fridges used combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
