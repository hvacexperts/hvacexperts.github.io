Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the very same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space cooling offers optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
