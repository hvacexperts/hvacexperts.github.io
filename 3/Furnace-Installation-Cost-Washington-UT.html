<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
