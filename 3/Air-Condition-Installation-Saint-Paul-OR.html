<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical power, a heatpump is an affordable option using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse.

<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet likewise contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.

<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtering should have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.
