<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
