<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
