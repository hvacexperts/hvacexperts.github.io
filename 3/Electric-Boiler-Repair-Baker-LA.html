<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your air conditioner is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just including refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A trained technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than designs made 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older.

A structure walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings might be helpful. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungis or bacteria and need to be removed, likewise. In some scenarios, specific screening for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of structure occupancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
