<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
