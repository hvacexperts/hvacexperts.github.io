<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
