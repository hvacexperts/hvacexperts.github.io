<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to your house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are expert and constantly on-time. Have been through a couple of companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
