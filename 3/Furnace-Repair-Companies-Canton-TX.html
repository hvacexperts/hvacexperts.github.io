<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was fast to react. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work.

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
