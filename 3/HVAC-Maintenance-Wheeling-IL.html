<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
