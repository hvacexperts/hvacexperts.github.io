Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they ought to be placed.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
