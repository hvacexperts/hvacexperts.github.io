<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are merely a reality of life. Molds can cause flare-ups of allergy symptoms, and in many cases, trigger asthma attacks. Germs, viruses, and germs likewise can reside in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne contaminants can affect your house convenience equipment, too. Enabled to circulate through your home and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, preventing air flow and minimizing heating and cooling efficiency.

<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
