Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
