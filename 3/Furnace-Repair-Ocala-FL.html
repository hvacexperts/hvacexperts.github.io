The companies were not made aware they belonged to a research study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or methods used. The EPA study prescribed and controlled approaches used on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have defects, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have changed because these research studies were performed, the duct in homes have not.<p>

<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Ocala FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a series of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, nausea, confusion, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in people with persistent heart problem. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are in some cases puzzled with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, senior people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory illness can be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide gas direct exposures.<p>

<h3>Commercial Heat Pumps in Ocala FL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
