<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply.

<p>The ability of organic chemicals to trigger health effects varies significantly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those with no recognized health result. Just like other pollutants, the degree and nature of the health result will depend upon many elements including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory system irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual conditions, and memory disability are among the instant symptoms that some people have experienced not long after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health impacts happen from the levels of organics normally discovered in homes. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are presumed of causing, or are known to trigger, cancer in human beings.<p>
