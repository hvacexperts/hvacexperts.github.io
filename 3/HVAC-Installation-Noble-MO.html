In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Numerous elements impact IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the structure.
