<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Numerous elements impact IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature, high or low humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the structure. Often, particular pollutants like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas over time) may trigger poor IAQ.<p>
