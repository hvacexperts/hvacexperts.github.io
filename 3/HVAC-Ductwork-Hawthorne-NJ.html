<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
