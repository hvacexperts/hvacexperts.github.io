Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
