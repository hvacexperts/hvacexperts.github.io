<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure.

Outdoor CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures.
