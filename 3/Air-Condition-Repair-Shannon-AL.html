<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Shannon AL</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
