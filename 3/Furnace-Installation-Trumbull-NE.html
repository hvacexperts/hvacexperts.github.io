<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
