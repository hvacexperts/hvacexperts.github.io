He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
