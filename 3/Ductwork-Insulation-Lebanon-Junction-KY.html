<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have remained in existence considering that the mid-90s, and the concept developed much earlier than that, its application in houses is still fairly brand-new. That indicates there are fewer expert installers than with standard systems, and less competitors means greater costs. In basic, due to the fact that it is still not extensively embraced, it can also be a challenge to discover experienced installers at your place.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
