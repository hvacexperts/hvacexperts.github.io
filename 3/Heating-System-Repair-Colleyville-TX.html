<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
