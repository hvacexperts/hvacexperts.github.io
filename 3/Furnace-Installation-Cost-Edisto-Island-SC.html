<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
