<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal.

We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was excellent. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
