<p>Sean was really handy. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
