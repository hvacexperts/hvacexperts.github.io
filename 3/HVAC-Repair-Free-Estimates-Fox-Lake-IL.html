<p>Before you go out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning system be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool the house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you need to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will substantially affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
