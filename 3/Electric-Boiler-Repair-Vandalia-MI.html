<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part. He was friendly, straightforward and a thoroughly satisfying person to have around that entire time. His time and expertise to RESOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heater) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Vandalia MI</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
