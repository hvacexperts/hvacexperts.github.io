<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
