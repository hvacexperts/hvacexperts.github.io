Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
