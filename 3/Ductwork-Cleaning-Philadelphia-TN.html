<p>This in flooring heating system includes one thin continuous cable television heating component woven into a mat that you set up under the tile. These heated floors are a task best done when changing the flooring or upgrading covering of an existing space or when including a new room. Heated flooring can be installed as additional heat to take the relax of the floor or as space heat to warm the entire bathroom. Heated flooring is also a terrific project for warming entrance and cooking area floors.<p>
