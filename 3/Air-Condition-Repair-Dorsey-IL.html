These should be taken into account before choosing the best design of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes needs fewer pipelines to accomplish the wanted underground heating and cooling effect, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators.

Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
