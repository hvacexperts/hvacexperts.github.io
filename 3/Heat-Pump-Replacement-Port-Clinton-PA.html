<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, given that it is protected inside. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
