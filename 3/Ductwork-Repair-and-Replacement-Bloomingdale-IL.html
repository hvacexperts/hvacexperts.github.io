<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
