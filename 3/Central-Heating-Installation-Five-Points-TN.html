<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
