<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles.

As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
