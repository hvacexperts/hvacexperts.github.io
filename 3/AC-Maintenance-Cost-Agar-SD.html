<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be positioned. Most frequently they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if people primarily stay seated in that particular location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll require to put the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
