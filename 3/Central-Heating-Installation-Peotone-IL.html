<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and homes matters, especially because we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
