<h3>Truth About Paradise UT Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heatpump should be free of all clogs and debris. Obstructions can block the flow of condensed water and trigger wetness accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature policy, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
