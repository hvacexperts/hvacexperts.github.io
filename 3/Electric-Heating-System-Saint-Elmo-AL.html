In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary environmental risk to the health of children in the United States."

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
