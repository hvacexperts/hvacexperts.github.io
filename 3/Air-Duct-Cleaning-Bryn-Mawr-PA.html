<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have.

Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
