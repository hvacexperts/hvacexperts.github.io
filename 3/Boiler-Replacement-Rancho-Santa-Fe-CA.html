<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
