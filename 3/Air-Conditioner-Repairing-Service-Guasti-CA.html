However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden appear greater than regular, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to discuss the cash you'll save on repair costs.

<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
