<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
