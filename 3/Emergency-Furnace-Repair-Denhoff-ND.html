Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits.

You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
