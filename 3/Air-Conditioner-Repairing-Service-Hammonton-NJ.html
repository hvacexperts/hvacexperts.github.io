<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
