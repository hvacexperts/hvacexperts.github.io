<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
