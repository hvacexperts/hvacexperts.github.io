Porous materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be discarded.

Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
