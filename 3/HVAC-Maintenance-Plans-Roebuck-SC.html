<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
