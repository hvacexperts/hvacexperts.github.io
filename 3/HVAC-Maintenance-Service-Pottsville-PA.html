<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
