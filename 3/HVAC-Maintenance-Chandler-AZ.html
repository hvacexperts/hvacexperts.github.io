Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
