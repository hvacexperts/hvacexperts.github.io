<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really helpful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
