<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
