It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
