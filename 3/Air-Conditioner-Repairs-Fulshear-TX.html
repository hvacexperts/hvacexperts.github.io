<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
