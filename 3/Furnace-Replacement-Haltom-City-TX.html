<h3>Electric Furnace in Haltom City TX</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
