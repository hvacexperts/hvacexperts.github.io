<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Children might have higher direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Belvedere Tiburon CA</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
