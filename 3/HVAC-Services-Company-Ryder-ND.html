<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building materials, cigarette smoking, home products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured products. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
