<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it may simply need to be cleaned up. Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's a good early remedy to try.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
