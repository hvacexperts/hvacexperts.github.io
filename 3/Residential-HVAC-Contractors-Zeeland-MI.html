<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources might not position a significant health threat by themselves, many houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that most people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to prevent new issues from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
