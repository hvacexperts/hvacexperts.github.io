<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Hiring Indian Hills CO HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that hinders the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a series of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, nausea, confusion, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with persistent cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are sometimes confused with the influenza or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, senior people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory illness can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
