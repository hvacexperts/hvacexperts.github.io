<p>When installing radiant heat, you must give serious idea to the kind of flooring covering in the home. Since it performs and shops heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work reasonably well. Carpets will directly insulate the flooring from the space, reducing effectiveness, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated space, use a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
