Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one action stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring usage of a part that runs out balance.
