<h3>HVAC Technician in Springfield NE</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimal effectiveness and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also cause your energy bills to increase. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work harder and may get too hot if the system is too little.
