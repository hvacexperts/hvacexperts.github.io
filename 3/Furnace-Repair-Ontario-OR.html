<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
