It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air purification technologies are ending up being more typical as available options in residential and commercial HVAC product packages.

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
