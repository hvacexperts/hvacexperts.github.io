<p>Intensifying the kept in mind health symptoms might be job tension. In part, due to various elements of workplace automation, the most difficult aspects of office work are increasing. Health symptoms related to job stress consist of mental and physical pressures such as aggravation, anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, stomach or gastro-intestinal disturbances, and muscle and psychological stress. These symptoms may be promoted by poor indoor quality.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure occupants might be exposed to a variety of impurities (in the type of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, construction furnishings, carpets and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor pollutants.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
