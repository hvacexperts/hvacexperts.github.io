<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Clarendon Hills IL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
