<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
