To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
