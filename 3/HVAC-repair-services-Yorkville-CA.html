<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and solidify-- usually 2 to four weeks.
