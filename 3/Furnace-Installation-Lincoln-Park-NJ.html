For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.
