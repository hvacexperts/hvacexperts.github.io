<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning products, building and construction activities, carpets and home furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside toxins.
