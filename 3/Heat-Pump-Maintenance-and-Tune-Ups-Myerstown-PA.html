<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
