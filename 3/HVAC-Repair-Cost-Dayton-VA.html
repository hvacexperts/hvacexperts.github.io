<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than lots of heat pump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you purchase.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.
