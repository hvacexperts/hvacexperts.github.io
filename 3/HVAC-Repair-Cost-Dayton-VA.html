<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than lots of heat pump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you purchase. Among the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
