For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside.

However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
