<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
