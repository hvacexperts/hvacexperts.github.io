One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in explaining what services would be performed.

He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
