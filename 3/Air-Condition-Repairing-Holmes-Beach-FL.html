<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
