<p>Air toxins can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off.

In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater correctly adjusted.

While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
