<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
