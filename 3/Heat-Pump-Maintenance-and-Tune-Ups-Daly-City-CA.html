A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
