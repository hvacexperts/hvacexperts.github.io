<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Graysville AL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning system prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>

<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
