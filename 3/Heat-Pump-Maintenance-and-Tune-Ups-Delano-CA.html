<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body.
