The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy efficient than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's five years old or older.
