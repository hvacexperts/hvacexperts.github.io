<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Company in Atoka TN</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

Electric furnaces start at $395 and vary approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
