<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them up until they have been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

This can result in the potential for considerable health issue.<p>
