<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the ideal temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, just be worried.
