<h3>Air Condition System in Central SC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
