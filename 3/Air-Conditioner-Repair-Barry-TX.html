<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Conservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
