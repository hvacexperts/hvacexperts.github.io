<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now.

<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness indoors is related to a higher frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
