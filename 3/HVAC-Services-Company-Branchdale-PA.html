<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
