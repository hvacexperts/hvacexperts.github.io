According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest average earnings for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
