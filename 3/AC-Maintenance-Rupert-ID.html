<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
