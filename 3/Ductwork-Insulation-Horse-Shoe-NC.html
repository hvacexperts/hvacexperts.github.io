<h3>Ductwork Installation in Horse Shoe NC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
