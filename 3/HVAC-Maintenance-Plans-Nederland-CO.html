<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
