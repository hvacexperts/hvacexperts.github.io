<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.. a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
