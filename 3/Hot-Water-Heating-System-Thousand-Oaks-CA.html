<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, especially given that we spend most of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might simply need to be cleaned up.

The following are standards; constantly describe your owner's manual. Keep in mind: Constantly switch off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>
