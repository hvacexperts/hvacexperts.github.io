<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd problem that occasionally turns up. When you do notice your furnace acting strangely, it is extremely important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you react to concerns with your furnace, the simpler they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the issue worse, and frequently more pricey.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold.

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Ductwork provides the conditioned air from your HVAC system throughout your house through vents frequently found in your house's attic and However, with time ductwork can lose its' efficiency or might require to be become deal with your brand-new AC system.
