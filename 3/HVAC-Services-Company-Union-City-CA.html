Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone. Just like determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, identifying the right size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
