<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
