This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
