<p>Let's start by outlining the planning that needs to take place prior to you in fact buy a furnace. Selecting a furnace for your home isn't as easy as choosing one off a showroom floor. Not all heaters are good for all houses, and there are a number of aspects that absolutely need to be thought about before selecting one.

Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved concerns. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
