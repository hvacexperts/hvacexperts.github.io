<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
