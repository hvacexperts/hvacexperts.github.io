<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Mechanicsville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
