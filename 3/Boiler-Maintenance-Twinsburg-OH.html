<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
