<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
