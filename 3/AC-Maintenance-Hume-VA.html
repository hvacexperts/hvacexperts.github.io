<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).
