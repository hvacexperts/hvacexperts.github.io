<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") describes how within air can impact an individual's health, convenience, and ability to work. It can consist of temperature level, humidity, lack of outdoors air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does supply standards about the most common IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>Because they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the system running.
