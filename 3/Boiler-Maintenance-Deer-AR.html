One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
