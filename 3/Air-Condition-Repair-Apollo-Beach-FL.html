<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
