They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
