<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years.

Make sure that kids wash their hands prior to meals, nap time, and bedtime.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
