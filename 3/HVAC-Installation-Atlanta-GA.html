<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
