This can be done through central heating Such a system consists of a furnace, boiler, or heat  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical space in a large building.

<p>A customized a/c that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
