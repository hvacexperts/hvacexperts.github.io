<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
