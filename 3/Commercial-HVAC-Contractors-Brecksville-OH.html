<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Brecksville OH</h3>
<p>Even newer furnaces less than 5 years old have actually been discovered as bad. A lot of homeowners are surprised to find out that their 'brand-new' furnace  heat exchanger. Sometimes it is because of poor furnace style, but in most cases, it's from neglect. Apotheosis Heating & Home Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Assessment of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which checks for debris on the burners, poor air flow, and a filthy filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as required. The Performance Check-Up (see previous answer above) is also important to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
