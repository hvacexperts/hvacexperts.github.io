<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
