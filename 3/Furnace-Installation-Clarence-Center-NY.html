There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
