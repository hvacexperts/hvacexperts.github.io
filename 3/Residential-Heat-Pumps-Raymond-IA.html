<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is combined.
