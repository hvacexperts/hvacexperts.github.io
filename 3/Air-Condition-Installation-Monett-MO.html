Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
