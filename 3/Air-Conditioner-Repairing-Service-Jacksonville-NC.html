<p>The function of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load computing is described as the Manual J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, determining the proper size of unit for your home also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>
