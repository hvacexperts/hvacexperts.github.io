<h3>Ductless AC System in Mansfield TX</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a cars and truck radiator or common family a/c unit does.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
