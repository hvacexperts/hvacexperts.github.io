<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Long Beach CA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow.
