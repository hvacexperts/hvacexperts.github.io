<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health results mentioned. However, it is not always true that the effects noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
