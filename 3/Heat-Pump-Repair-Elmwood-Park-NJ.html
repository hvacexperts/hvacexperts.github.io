<p>My oldest boy constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
