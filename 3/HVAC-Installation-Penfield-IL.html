<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on.

Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Penfield IL</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I must say it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
