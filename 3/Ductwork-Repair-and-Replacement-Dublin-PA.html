<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners.

Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
