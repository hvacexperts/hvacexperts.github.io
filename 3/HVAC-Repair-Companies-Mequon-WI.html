<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
