<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They chose they needed expert aid and spoke with numerous providers. Finally, after an extensive choice process, the space company picked Dometic.
