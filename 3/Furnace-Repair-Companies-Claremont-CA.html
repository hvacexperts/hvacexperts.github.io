<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Claremont CA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
