<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
