The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
