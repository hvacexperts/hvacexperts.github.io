<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in Richlands NC</h3>
<p>When the level of brand-new building and construction activity declines, technicians who specialize in new installation work may experience periods of unemployment. Repair and maintenance work, however, usually stays fairly steady. Business owners and property owners depend upon their climate-control or refrigeration systems all year and should keep them in good working order, despite financial conditions.<p>
<p>The majority of people don't realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can compromise the performance of the system and ultimately harm it enough that you need to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will thoroughly take a look at the connections and examine the performance of the system. They'll search for frayed and damaged wires and replace them in order to minimize the risk of fire and component failure.<p>
