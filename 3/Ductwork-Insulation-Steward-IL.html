<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
