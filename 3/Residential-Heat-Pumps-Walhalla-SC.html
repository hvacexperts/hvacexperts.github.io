<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Walhalla SC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
