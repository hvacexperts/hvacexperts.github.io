There is a threat of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to an experienced ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC medical diagnosis. Constantly make certain when inspecting your air conditioning equipment to switch off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch.

<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological impurities are moist or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.
