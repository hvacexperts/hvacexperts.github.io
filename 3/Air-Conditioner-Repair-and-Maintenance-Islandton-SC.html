Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
