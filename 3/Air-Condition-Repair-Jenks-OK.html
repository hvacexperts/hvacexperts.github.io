<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtration ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Mentioning air, radiant heat systems tend to improve indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems flow airborne pollutants throughout the home throughout operation, provoking a range of various negative results.
