<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up.
