<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
