<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
