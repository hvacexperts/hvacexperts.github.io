<p>Are you including a new room onto your home? Possibly you have a space with unique heating and cooling obstacles, such as rooms that constantly seem to be too hot or too cold. That's where ductless Air conditionings come in! Also called mini divides" or split level Air conditioners," ductless Air conditioners can be set up in your house without all the pesky ductwork that comes with standard HVAC systems.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up right after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may become clogged, reducing air circulation distribution, volume, and quality.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be correctly maintained to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
