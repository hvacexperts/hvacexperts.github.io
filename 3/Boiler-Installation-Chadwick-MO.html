<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.
