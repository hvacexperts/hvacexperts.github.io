<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
