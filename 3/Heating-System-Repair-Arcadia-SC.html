<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
