<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
