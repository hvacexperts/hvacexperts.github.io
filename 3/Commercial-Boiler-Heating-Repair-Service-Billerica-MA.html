<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
