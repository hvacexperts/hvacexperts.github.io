<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
