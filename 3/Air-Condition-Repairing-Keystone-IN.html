<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
