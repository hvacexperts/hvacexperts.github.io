With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, enabling an improved value proposal for a more comprehensive set of customers.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house.
