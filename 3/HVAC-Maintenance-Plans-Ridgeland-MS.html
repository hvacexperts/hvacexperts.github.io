<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
