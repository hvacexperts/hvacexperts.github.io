<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it since it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
