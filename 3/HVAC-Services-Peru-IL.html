<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
