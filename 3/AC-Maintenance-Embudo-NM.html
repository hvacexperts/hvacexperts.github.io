<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
