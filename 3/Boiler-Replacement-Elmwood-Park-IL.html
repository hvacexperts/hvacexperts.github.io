<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
