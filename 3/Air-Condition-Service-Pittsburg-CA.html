<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heater can also be connected to a device referred to as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information might determine potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
