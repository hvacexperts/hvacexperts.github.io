<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
