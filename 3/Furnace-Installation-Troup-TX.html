<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like an area heating system) with the very same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
