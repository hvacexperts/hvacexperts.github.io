<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.
