<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Our technicians describe all of your alternatives before beginning the repair, so you can decide whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our Not A Surprises Rates-- consisting of charging by the job, not by the hour-- implies the price we estimate you is the rate you pay. If you choose that changing your furnace is the best course of action, we can set up a new, high-efficiency model in its place.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
