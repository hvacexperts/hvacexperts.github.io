<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Brookline NH</h3>
<p>Many people know that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can also have substantial, damaging effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading 5 ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
