<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Saint Joe IN</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.
