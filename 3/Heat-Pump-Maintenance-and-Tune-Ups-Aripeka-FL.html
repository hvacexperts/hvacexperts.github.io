<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
