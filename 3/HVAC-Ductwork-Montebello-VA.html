<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
