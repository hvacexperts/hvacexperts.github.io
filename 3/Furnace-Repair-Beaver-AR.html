<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can typically be performed in just a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>The homes and composition of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

Soil with positive heat transfer properties needs fewer pipes to accomplish the preferred underground heating & cooling impact, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will need more pipes.<p>
<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences.
