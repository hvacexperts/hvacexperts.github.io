<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
