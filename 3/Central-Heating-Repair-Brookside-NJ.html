<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense.

He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
