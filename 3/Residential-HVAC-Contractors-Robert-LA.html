<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
