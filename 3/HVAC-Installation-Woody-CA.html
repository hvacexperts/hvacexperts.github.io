<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
