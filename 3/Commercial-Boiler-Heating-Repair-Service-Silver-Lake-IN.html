<p>When setting up the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather costly. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to stream and increase out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use really little energy, but care must be required to guarantee comfort. In warm or damp climates, keeping thermal comfort solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise use outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
