<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
