<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Elverson PA - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
