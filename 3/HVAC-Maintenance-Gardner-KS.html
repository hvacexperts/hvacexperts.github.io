<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power must not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, however likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide agreements.  The so called respectable companies dupe more people than the fly by night outfits.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
