<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
