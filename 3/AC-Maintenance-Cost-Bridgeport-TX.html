<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that someone as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
