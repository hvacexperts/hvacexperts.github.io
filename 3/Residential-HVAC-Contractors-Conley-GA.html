As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
