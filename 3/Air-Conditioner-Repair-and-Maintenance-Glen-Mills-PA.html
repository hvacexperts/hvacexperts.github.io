<p>We look at hints before we supply recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
