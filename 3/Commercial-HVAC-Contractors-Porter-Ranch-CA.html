<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
