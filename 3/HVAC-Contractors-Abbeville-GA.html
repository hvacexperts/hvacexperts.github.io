<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint products, and auto emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene direct exposure consist of getting rid of smoking within the home, attending to optimum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint materials and special fuels that will not be utilized immediately.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your car. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
