<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
