<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
