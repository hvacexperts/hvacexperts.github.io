In this case, the control system is very vital to keeping a proper temperature.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
