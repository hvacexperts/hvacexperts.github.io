From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins streaming through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.
