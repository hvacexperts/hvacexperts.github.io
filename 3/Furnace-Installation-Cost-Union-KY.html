<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of environmentally friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion.
