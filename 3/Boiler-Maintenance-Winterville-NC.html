<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
