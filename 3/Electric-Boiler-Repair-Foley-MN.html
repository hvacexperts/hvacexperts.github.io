<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.
