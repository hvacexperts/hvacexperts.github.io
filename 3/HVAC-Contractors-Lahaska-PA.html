<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room.
