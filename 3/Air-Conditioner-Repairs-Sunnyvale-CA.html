Load calculating is described as the Manual J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based on BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your home likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

If the system is too small, then your home won't be heated up adequately and the system will need to continuously run to attempt to heat the entire house, which will increase heating costs.<p>

Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
