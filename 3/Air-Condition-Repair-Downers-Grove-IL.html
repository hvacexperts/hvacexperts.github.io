<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
