<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Boyd TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
