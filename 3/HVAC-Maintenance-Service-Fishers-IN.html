<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems at Fishers IN</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the required electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their efficiency over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
