<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>All cooling contractors must begin their assessment of your house by carrying out an A/c Contractors of America Handbook J load estimation. This figures out the heat gain your home undergoes. The computation is reasonably simple to perform and will expose what size unit you require. Proceed to another contractor if the one you're considering wishes to determine the right system for your home exclusively on experience. Though strongly influenced by where you live, a number of factors affect the size unit needed, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun. The computation can also alert you to the possible benefits of updating the insulation in your home. By making your house more energy efficient, you may be able to decrease the size of the air conditioning unit you require.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites should discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a terrible, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
