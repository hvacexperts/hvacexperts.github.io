<h3>Strategies for Fast Furnace Repair at Madera CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
