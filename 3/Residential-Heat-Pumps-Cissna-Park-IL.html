<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Cissna Park IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
