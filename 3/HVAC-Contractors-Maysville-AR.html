Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
