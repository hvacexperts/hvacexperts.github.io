<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Burlington</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all recently constructed houses in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article forecasted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>
