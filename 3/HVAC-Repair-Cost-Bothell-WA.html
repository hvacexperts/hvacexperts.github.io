<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
