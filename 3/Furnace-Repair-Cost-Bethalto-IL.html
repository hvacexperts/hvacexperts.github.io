<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
