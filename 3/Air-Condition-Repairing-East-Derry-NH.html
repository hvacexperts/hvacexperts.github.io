<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
