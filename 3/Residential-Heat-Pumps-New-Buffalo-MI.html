Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated house again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to assist us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my pals.<p>
