<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Richland SC</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor.

<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your home.

<p>Some biological impurities set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.
