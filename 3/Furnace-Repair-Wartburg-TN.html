<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Wartburg TN HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
