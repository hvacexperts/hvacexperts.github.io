<p>Do not stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't obtained. There are many different reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you might be having problem with your Nest smart thermostat. Check your emergency breakers first. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Inspect if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace.
