<h3>Truth About Mascoutah IL Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise innovation. Martin said the company can develop a dashboard within the structure's controls that will offer data on its systems to enable real time exposure, offering the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial client, not simply during brand-new building and construction.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
