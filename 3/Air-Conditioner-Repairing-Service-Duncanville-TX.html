<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
