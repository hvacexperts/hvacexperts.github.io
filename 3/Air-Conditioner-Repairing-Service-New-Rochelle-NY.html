<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, however rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reputable  source of energy.<p>
