<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many individuals presume pollution is simply an outdoor issue, your house (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe adequate about exposure to all the things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
