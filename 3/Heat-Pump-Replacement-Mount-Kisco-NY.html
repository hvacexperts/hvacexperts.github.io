<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
