<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
