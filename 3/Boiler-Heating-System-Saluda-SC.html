<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty.
