<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>House owners may likewise presume that since a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a house enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's worth. No proof exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively affects property worths.

Maybe Realtors must consider too many variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system might add to, or subtract from, any offered asking price. That said, homebuyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
