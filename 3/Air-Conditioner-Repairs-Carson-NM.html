<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output.
