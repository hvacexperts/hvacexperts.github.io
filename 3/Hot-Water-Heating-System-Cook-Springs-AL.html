This is usually used in a third-floor or 2nd location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
