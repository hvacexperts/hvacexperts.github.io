<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Also, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
