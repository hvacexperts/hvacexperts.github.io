<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
