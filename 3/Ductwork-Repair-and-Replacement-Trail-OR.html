<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, babies, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Kids may have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems come with a variety of special functions that can even more enhance performance and efficiency. For example, property owners might want to try to find one that includes a built-in filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be altered.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
