<p>Heaters are like cars and trucks. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

The typical house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air escapes the system.<p>
