<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

It has also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and might cause cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the professionals thought they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
