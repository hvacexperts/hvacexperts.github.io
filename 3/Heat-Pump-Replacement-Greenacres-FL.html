<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those measurements on hand when looking for an air conditioning unit to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
