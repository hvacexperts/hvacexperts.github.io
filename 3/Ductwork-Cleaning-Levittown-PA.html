<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
