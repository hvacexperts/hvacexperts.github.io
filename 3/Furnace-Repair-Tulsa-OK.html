<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungis or bacteria and require to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be checked every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
