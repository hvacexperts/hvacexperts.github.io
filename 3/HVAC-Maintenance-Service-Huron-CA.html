<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>

If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
