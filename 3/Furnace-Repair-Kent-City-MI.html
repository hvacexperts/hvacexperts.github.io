<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
