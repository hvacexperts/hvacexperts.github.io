<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Atwood IN</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
