<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
