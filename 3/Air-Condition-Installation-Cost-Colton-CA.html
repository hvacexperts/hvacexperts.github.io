<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Colton CA?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
