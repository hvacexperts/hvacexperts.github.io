Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified representative from a company or merchant to do the installation.

A voided guarantee won't do you any great ought to the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and hire a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
