<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
