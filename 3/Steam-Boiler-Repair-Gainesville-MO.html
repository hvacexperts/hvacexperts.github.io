<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned up if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether this is the cause of the problem, it's an excellent early treatment to try.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
