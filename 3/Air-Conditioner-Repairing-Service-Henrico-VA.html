<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
