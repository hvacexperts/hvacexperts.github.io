<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
