Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern.
