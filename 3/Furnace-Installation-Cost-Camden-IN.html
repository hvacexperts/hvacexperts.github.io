<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
