The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>

A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
