<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
