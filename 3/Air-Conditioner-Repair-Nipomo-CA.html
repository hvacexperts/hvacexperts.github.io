My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
