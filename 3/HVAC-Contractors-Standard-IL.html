HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
