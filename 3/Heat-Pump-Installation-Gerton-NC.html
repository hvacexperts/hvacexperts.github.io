A number of individuals we have worked for feel more like family than clients.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these small but substantial changes in his bid. Since of recent warmer summers and for environmental factors, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>House owners may likewise presume that since a radiant flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's value.
