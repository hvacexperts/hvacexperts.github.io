<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter when every three months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
