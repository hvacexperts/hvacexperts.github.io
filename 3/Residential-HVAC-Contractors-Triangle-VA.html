In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very critical to preserving a proper temperature.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
