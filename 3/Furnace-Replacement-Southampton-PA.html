<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
