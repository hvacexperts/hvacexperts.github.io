<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

As a result your oil or gas furnace might run longer to provide the very same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to go up.
