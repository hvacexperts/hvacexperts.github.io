Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Waxhaw NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
