<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
