<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each space in your house, and if it develops fractures which leak, they need to be fixed. Having defective ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse outcomes. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy expenses will increase. Setting up new ductwork for the whole house will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a cruel, vicious summer.<p>
