<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same period. Essentially, SEER offers more information based on how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check.
