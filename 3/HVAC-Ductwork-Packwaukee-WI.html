<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
