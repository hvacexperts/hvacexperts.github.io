<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
