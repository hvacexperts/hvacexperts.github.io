<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
