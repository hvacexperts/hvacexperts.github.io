Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation organisation totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
