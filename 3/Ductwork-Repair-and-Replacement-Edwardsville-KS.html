Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could search for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
