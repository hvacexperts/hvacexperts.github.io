Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
