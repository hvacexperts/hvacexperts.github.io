<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
