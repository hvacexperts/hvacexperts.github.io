<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Liberty Center IN</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
