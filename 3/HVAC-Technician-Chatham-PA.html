<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working efficiently, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
