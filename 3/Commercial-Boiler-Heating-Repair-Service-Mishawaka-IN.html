<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air.
