<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
