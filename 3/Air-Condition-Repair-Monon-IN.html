The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house.

Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy.
