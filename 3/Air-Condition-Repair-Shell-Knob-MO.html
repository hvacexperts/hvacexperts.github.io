<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>There are many actions a house owner can require to select items that will prevent indoor air issues from happening - a number of them are pointed out here.
