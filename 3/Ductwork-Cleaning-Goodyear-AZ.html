The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank should be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations). The systems should be inspected a minimum of twice annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to get rid of dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually inspected at least. This inspection is an important element of HVAC maintenance.

That's the last thing you want because you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is fixed. Routine evaluation and maintenance also helps keep it in great shape and extends its life.<p>
