<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The structure type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples evaluated were checked positive for fungis and germs.<p>
