<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
