<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

While geothermal systems do use some electricity, they release far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
