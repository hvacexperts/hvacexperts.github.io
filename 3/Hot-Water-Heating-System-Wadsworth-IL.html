<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically greater than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the model you buy. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives. This indicates it can warm up your house to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
