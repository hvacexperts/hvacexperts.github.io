<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
