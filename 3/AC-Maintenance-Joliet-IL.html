<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
