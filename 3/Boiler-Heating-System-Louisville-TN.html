<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your house, and if it establishes cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your home will not be effectively cooled, and your energy expenses will go up. Installing new ductwork for the whole house will cost an average of between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our options did an outstanding job in making sure we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The professionals who installed the new system were fast and professional, while taking some time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
