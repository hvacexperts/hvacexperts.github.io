Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
